It has been described as one of the most horrific frontier massacres of the war. A mixed force of Loyalists, British soldiers, Seneca and Mohawks descended on Cherry Valley, whose defenders, despite warnings, were unprepared for the attack. During the raid, the Seneca in particular targeted non-combatants, and reports state that 30 such individuals were slain, in addition to a number of armed defenders. The raiders were under the overall command of Walter Butler, who exercised little authority over the Indians on the expedition. Historian Barbara Graymont describes Butler\'s command of the expedition as "criminally incompetent". The Seneca were angered by accusations that they had committed atrocities at the Battle of Wyoming, and the colonists\' recent destruction of their forward bases of operation at Unadilla, Onaquaga, and Tioga. Butler\'s authority with the Indians was undermined by his poor treatment of Joseph Brant, the leader of the Mohawks. Butler repeatedly maintained, against accusations that he permitted the atrocities to take place, that he was powerless to restrain the Seneca. During the campaigns of 1778, Brant achieved an undeserved reputation for brutality. He was not present at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the "butchers" and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy as to who actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.\nevents: t0: November 11 , 1778, t1: 1778, t2: 1779, t3: the American Revolutionary War, e0: described, e1: descended on, e2: targeted, e3: exercised, e4: committed, e5: permitted, e6: restrain, e7: achieved, e8: minimize, e9: took place, e10: given, e11: ordered, e12: restrain, e13: contributed, e14: drove\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The formal occupation began in 1912, even though there were various other assaults by the U.S. in Nicaragua throughout this period. American military interventions in Nicaragua were designed to stop any other nation except the United States of America from building a Nicaraguan Canal. Nicaragua assumed a quasi-protectorate status under the 1916 Bryan–Chamorro Treaty. President Herbert Hoover (1929–1933) opposed the relationship.

In the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company ("Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie", "VOC") began the campaign to destroy Portuguese power in the East. At that time, the Portuguese had transformed Malacca into an impregnable fortress (the "Fortaleza de Malaca"), controlling access to the sea lanes of the Straits of Malacca and the spice trade there. The Dutch started by launching small incursions and skirmishes against the Portuguese. The first serious attempt was the siege of Malacca in 1606 by the third VOC fleet from Holland with eleven ships, led by Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge that lead to the naval battle of Cape Rachado. Although the Dutch were routed, the Portuguese fleet of Martim Afonso de Castro, the Viceroy of Portuguese India, suffered heavier casualties and the battle rallied the forces of the Sultanate of Johor in an alliance with the Dutch. The Dutch with their local allies assaulted and wrested Malacca from the Portuguese in January 1641. This combined Dutch-Johor effort effectively destroyed the last bastion of Portuguese power, removing their influence in the Malay archipelago. In line with the agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch took control of Malacca and agreed not to seek territories or wage war with the Malay kingdoms.\nevents: t0: 2 August 1640 – 14 January 1641, t1: the early 17th century, t2: January 1641, t3: 1606, t4: that time, t5: 1606, e0: Battle, e1: capture, e2: began, e3: destroy, e4: transformed, e5: controlling, e6: started, e7: launching, e8: siege, e9: led, e10: lead to, e11: casualties, e12: battle, e13: rallied, e14: assaulted, e15: combined, e16: destroyed, e17: removing, e18: took, e19: control, e20: agreed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The United Nations and NATO later expanded the mission of the operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in Bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in Bosnia. Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties. The operation played an important role in shaping both the Bosnian War and NATO. The operation included the first combat engagement in NATO's history, a 28 February 1994 air battle over Banja Luka, and in April 1994, NATO aircraft first bombed ground targets in an operation near Goražde. These engagements helped show that NATO had adapted to the post-Cold War era and could operate in environments other than a major force on force engagement on the plains of Central Europe. Cooperation between the UN and NATO during the operation also helped pave the way for future joint operations. Although it helped establish UN-NATO relations, Deny Flight led to conflict between the two organizations. Most notably, significant tension arose between the two after UN peacekeepers were taken as hostages in response to NATO bombing. The operations of Deny Flight spanned more than two years of the Bosnian War and played an important role in the course of that conflict. The no-fly zone operations of Deny Flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in the conflict. Additionally, the air strikes flown during Deny Flight led to Operation Deliberate Force, a massive NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia that played a key role in ending the war.\nevents: t0: 12 april 1993, t1: 20 December 1995, t2: 28 February 1994, t3: April 1994, t4: more than two years, e0: began, e1: expanded, e2: providing, e3: carrying out, e4: contributed, e5: end, e6: flown, e7: played, e8: combat, e9: bombed, e10: helped, e11: adapted, e12: operate, e13: helped, e14: helped, e15: establish, e16: led to, e17: conflict, e18: arose, e19: taken, e20: response, e21: bombing, e22: spanned, e23: played, e24: conflict, e25: use, e26: strikes, e27: flown, e28: led to, e29: operation, e30: bombing, e31: played, e32: ending\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The hotel was the site of the central offices of the British Mandatory authorities of Palestine, principally the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in Palestine and Transjordan. When planned, the attack had the approval of the Haganah, the principal Jewish paramilitary group in Palestine, though, unbeknownst to the Irgun, this had been cancelled by the time the operation was carried out. It was conceived as part of a response to Operation Agatha (a series of widespread raids, including one on the Jewish Agency, conducted by the British authorities) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era (1920–1948). Disguised as Arab workmen and as hotel waiters, members of the Irgun planted a bomb in the basement of the main building of the hotel, whose southern wing housed the Mandate Secretariat and a few offices of the British military headquarters. The resulting explosion caused the collapse of the western half of the southern wing of the hotel. Some of the inflicted deaths and injuries occurred in the road outside the hotel and in adjacent buildings. The Irgun sent warnings by telephone, including one to the hotel\'s own switchboard, which, possibly because hoax bomb warnings were rife at the time, the staff decided to ignore, but none directly to the British authorities. From the fact that a bomb search had already been carried out, it appears that a hoax call or tip-off had been received at the hotel earlier that day. Subsequent telephone calls from a concerned "Palestine Post" staff member and the police caused increasing alarm, and the hotel manager was notified. In the closing minutes before the explosion, he called an unknown British officer, but no evacuation was ordered. Controversy has arisen over the timing and adequacy of the warnings, and the reasons why, given that warnings were made, the hotel was not evacuated.\nevents: t0: 1920–1948, t1: earlier that day, t2: Monday , July 22 , 1946, t3: the time, t4: the closing minutes, e0: bombing, e1: attack, e2: carried out, e3: killed, e4: injured, e5: planned, e6: attack, e7: approval, e8: cancelled, e9: operation, e10: carried out, e11: conceived, e12: response, e13: raids, e14: conducted, e15: directed, e16: Disguised, e17: planted, e18: explosion, e19: caused, e20: collapse, e21: deaths, e22: injuries, e23: occurred, e24: sent, e25: warnings, e26: warnings, e27: decided, e28: search, e29: carried out, e30: received, e31: calls, e32: caused, e33: notified, e34: explosion, e35: called, e36: evacuation, e37: ordered, e38: arisen, e39: warnings, e40: given, e41: warnings, e42: evacuated\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Defenders of the warehouse held out against numerous waves of Japanese forces and covered Chinese forces retreating west during the Battle of Shanghai. The successful defense of the warehouse provided a morale-lifting consolation to the Chinese army and people in the demoralizing aftermath of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai. The warehouse's location just across the Suzhou Creek from the foreign concessions in Shanghai meant the battle took place in full view of the western powers. It was across from the foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Japanese did not dare to call naval artillery strikes on the area, since a stray shot might land in the concessions and provoke an incident with the Europeans and Americans, whom the Japanese wanted to keep out of the war. Moreover, the Japanese dared not use mustard gas here as they did elsewhere in Shanghai, in full view of the foreign powers. This proximity drew the attention, if only briefly, of the international community to Chiang Kai-shek's bid for worldwide support against Japanese aggression.

The Minnesota Territory itself was formed only in 1849 but the area had a rich history well before this. Though there was a long history of European presence in the area before 19th century, it was during the 19th century that the United States began to establish a firm presence in what would become Minnesota. Many of the facets of Minnesota culture that are perceived as the area\'s "early" history in fact originated after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, the first half of the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, and to some degree, lawlessness. This era was a period of economic transition. The dominant enterprise in the area since the 17th century had been the fur trade. The Dakota Sioux, and later the Ojibwe, tribes hunted and gathered pelts trading with French, British, and later American traders at Grand Portage, Mendota, and other sites. This trade gradually declined during the early 19th century as demand for furs in Europe diminished. The lumber industry grew rapidly, replacing furs as the key economic resource. Grain production began to develop late during this time as an emerging economic basis as well. Saw mills, and later grain mills, around Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls in east-central Minnesota became magnets for development. By the end of the era east-central Minnesota had replaced northern Minnesota as the economic center of the area. This era was also as a period of cultural transition. At the time the U.S. took possession of the region, Native Americans were by far the largest ethnic groups. Their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the French, British, and Americans asserted territorial claims on the area. French and British traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed-race peoples. As the Americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined, the dynamics changed dramatically. The economic influence of the Native Americans diminished and American territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence. Large waves of immigration in the 1850s very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of European descent. The native and mixed-race populations continued to influence the territory\'s culture and politics, even at the end of the territorial era, though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline. Heavy immigration from New England and New York led to Minnesota\'s being labeled the "New England of the West".\nevents: t0: 1803, t1: 1858, t2: 1849, t3: 19th century, t4: the 19th century, t5: the later 19th century, t6: later years, t7: the first half of the 19th century, t8: the 17th century, t9: the early 19th century, t10: the 1850s, t11: a few years, e0: formed, e1: began, e2: establish, e3: become, e4: perceived, e5: originated, e6: known, e7: occurred, e8: hunted, e9: gathered, e10: declined, e11: diminished, e12: replacing, e13: began, e14: develop, e15: became, e16: replaced, e17: transition, e18: took, e19: gave, e20: influence, e21: asserted, e22: mixed, e23: contributing, e24: creating, e25: changed, e26: diminished, e27: limit, e28: changed, e29: shifted, e30: influence, e31: achieved, e32: led to\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The outnumbered French repelled several Allied assaults on their right flank, but their center and left flank were overcome and Soult was compelled to retreat. At first the withdrawal was conducted in good order, but it eventually ended in a scramble for safety and many French soldiers became prisoners. The engagement occurred near the end of the Peninsular War. In mid-February, Wellington's army broke out of its small area of conquered territory near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. After a pause in the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse.

The tour supported her 1986 third studio album "True Blue", as well as the 1987 soundtrack "Who\'s That Girl". It was Madonna\'s first world tour, reaching Asia, North America and Europe. Musically and technically superior to her previous initiative, the Who\'s That Girl Tour incorporated multimedia components to make the show more appealing. Madonna trained physically doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to cope with the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who\'s That Girl came to Madonna\'s mind when during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage. The show consisted of seven costume changes, with song-and-dance routines, theatrics and addressing social causes. The tour was critically appreciated, with reviewers commending the extravagant nature of the concert and Madonna as a performer. It was a commercial success, grossing in total of US $25 million ($ million in dollars) by playing in front of 1.5 million audience. According to Pollstar, it was the second highest-grossing female concert tour of 1987, behind Tina Turner\'s Break Every Rule Tour. Who\'s That Girl was broadcast in a number of international television channels and was released in VHS titled "". Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli commented that "Many female artists behave like a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the \'Who\'s That Girl?\' tour marked the beginning of Madonna\'s." It is also noted for giving rise to the term "new Madonna", a stronger and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe. A statue of Madonna, wearing a conical bra, was erected in her name at the center of the town of Pacentro in Italy, where her ancestors used to live.\nevents: t0: 1986, t1: 1987, t2: 1987, e0: tour, e1: supported, e2: reaching, e3: incorporated, e4: make, e5: trained, e6: jogging, e7: collaborated, e8: expanding, e9: bringing, e10: presenting, e11: looked, e12: projected, e13: changes, e14: addressing, e15: causes, e16: commending, e17: concert, e18: playing, e19: concert, e20: broadcast, e21: released, e22: titled, e23: commented, e24: reach, e25: marked, e26: noted, e27: given rise to, e28: wearing, e29: erected, e30: used\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November 9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November 15. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November 17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November 20 as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November 21 before dissipating early the next day. The majority of deaths associated with Forrest resulted from a plane crash on November 14 in Vietnam which killed 30 of the 31 occupants. In Thailand, the system produced significant storm surge, damaged or destroyed 1,700 homes, and killed two people. Agricultural losses in the hardest hit areas were estimated at ฿800 million (US$32 million). On November 20, as Forrest reached its peak intensity, fears arose across Bangladesh that a repeat of the catastrophic April 1991 cyclone would take place. As a result, mass evacuation plans were enacted across coastal areas of the country, with plans to relocate up to 2 million people. But the storm abruptly turned eastward, and the successful evacuation of 600,000 residents spared countless lives. Only two deaths were recorded and overall damage was light, though half of all homes on St. Martin's Island were damaged.\nevents: t0: late november 1992, t1: November 9, t2: three days later, t3: November 15, t4: November 17, t5: November 20, t6: November 21, t7: early the next day, t8: November 14, t9: November 20, t10: April 1991, e0: cyclone, e1: referred, e2: storm, e3: cyclone, e4: prompted, e5: evacuation, e6: Originating, e7: classified, e8: Tracking, e9: organized, e10: storm, e11: passing, e12: striking, e13: turned, e14: intensified, e15: reached, e16: cyclone, e17: hurricane, e18: cyclone, e19: turned, e20: landfall, e21: deaths, e22: resulted, e23: crash, e24: killed, e25: produced, e26: storm, e27: damaged, e28: destroyed, e29: killed, e30: losses, e31: hit, e32: reached, e33: repeat, e34: cyclone, e35: take place, e36: evacuation, e37: enacted, e38: relocate, e39: storm, e40: turned, e41: evacuation, e42: deaths, e43: recorded, e44: damage, e45: damaged\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a "greater confusion of purpose", yet they led to a war noted for its "notoriously incompetent international butchery". While the churches worked out their differences and came to an agreement, Nicholas I of Russia and the French Emperor Napoleon III refused to back down. Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to. When the Ottomans demanded changes, Nicholas refused and prepared for war. Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain, the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853. The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities (now part of Romania), which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. A separate action on the fort town of Kars in eastern Anatolia led to a siege, and a Turkish attempt to reinforce the garrison was destroyed by a Russian fleet at Sinop. Fearing an Ottoman collapse, France and Britain rushed forces to Gallipoli. They then moved north to Varna in June 1854, arriving just in time for the Russians to abandon Silistra. Aside from a minor skirmish at Köstence (today Constanța), there was little for the allies to do. Karl Marx quipped, "there they are, the French doing nothing and the British helping them as fast as possible". Frustrated by the wasted effort, and with demands for action from their citizens, the allied force decided to attack Russia\'s main naval base in the Black Sea at Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula. After extended preparations, the forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and marched their way to a point south of Sevastopol after the successful Battle of the Alma. The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed, but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces. A second counterattack, at Inkerman, ended in stalemate. The front settled into a siege and led to brutal conditions for troops on both sides. Smaller military actions took place in the Baltic, the Caucasus, the White Sea, and the North Pacific. Sevastopol fell after eleven months, and neutral countries began to join the Allied cause. Isolated and facing a bleak prospect of invasion from the west if the war continued, Russia sued for peace in March 1856. France and Britain welcomed this development, as the conflict was growing unpopular at home. The Treaty of Paris, signed on 30 March 1856, ended the war. It forbade Russia from basing warships in the Black Sea. The Ottoman vassal states of Wallachia and Moldavia became largely independent. Christians there were granted a degree of official equality, and the Orthodox Church regained control of the Christian churches in dispute. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways, and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs. As the legend of the "Charge of the Light Brigade" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement. The reaction in Britain was a demand for professionalisation, most famously achieved by Florence Nightingale, who gained worldwide attention for pioneering modern nursing while treating the wounded. The Crimean War proved to be the moment of truth for Nikolaevan Russia. The humiliation forced Russia\'s educated elites to identify the Empire\'s problems and to recognize the need for fundamental transformations aimed at modernizing and restoring Russia\'s position in the ranks of European powers. Historians have studied the role of the Crimean War as a catalyst for the reforms of Russia\'s social institutions: serfdom, justice, local self-government, education, and military service. More recently, scholars have also turned their attention to the impact of the Crimean War on the development of Russian nationalistic discourse.\nevents: t0: October 1853, t1: February 1856, t2: October 1853, t3: June 1854, t4: 25 October, t5: 30 march 1856, t6: July 1853, t7: eleven months, t8: March 1856, t9: September 1854, e0: conflict, e1: fought, e2: lost, e3: involved, e4: promoted, e5: promoted, e6: involved, e7: decline, e8: allow, e9: gain, e10: expense, e11: noted, e12: involving, e13: revealed, e14: noted, e15: worked out, e16: came to, e17: refused, e18: issued, e19: placed, e20: attempted, e21: mediate, e22: arranged, e23: agreed, e24: demanded, e25: changes, e26: refused, e27: prepared, e28: obtained, e29: support, e30: declared, e31: started, e32: occupied, e33: began, e34: Led, e35: fought, e36: defensive, e37: stopped, e38: attempt, e39: reinforce, e40: destroyed, e41: rushed, e42: moved, e43: arriving, e44: abandon, e45: quipped, e46: helping, e47: Frustrated, e48: decided, e49: attack, e50: extended, e51: landed, e52: marched, e53: counterattacked, e54: Battle, e55: repulsed, e56: cost, e57: depleting, e58: counterattack, e59: ended, e60: settled, e61: took place, e62: fell, e63: began, e64: join, e65: Isolated, e66: facing, e67: invasion, e68: sued, e69: welcomed, e70: conflict, e71: growing, e72: signed on, e73: ended, e74: forbade, e75: granted, e76: regained, e77: control, e78: conflicts, e79: used, e80: documented, e81: demand, e82: achieved, e83: gained, e84: treating, e85: proved, e86: forced, e87: educated, e88: identify, e89: recognize, e90: aimed, e91: restoring, e92: studied, e93: reforms, e94: service, e95: turned, e96: impact\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It took place on November 14, 1999, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. The main event was a Triple Threat match–a non-elimination match involving three wrestlers against each other; for the WWF Championship between Triple H, Big Show and The Rock. Big Show won the title. He was a replacement for Stone Cold Steve Austin, who had been run down by a car earlier in the night (which was an angle for Austin to take time to recover from his injuries).

Fought between an unorganised Polish troop of ca. 100 men under Aleksander Rogaliński and a company of the Russian Murom Regiment under Col. Kozlaninov, the skirmish resulted in Polish victory. As the engagement started on the very first day of the uprising, the Russian force still obeyed the orders of marching through the occupied country with their rifles unloaded. When the Russians approached a local manor in which the Poles had their quarters, the Russian commander ordered a loose formation and tried to negotiate an agreement and take all Poles into captivity. However, Rogaliński refused to negotiate and ordered a charge of the Russians. After a short hand-to-hand fight (the Polish unit had only two pieces of firearms and was mostly equipped with sabres, war scythes and improvised weapons), the Russian commander was killed and his unit dispersed.

She died following an attempt by police officers to detain her for deportation. During a police raid on her home in Crouch End, London, she was restrained with handcuffs and leather straps and gagged with a 13-foot length of adhesive "Elastoplast" tape wrapped around her head. Unable to breathe, she collapsed and suffered brain damage due to asphyxia. She was placed on life support but died following a cardiac arrest four days later. In 1995, three of the police officers involved stood trial for Gardner\'s manslaughter, but were acquitted. The case became a cause célèbre for civil rights and justice campaigners, and for the first time brought wide public attention to what the "Modern Law Review" called "the inhumanity of the methods used routinely in the execution of deportation orders".

Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy, was killed on Bougainville Island when his transport bomber aircraft was shot down by United States Army Air Forces fighter aircraft operating from Kukum Field on Guadalcanal. The mission of the U.S. aircraft was specifically to kill Yamamoto and was based on United States Navy intelligence on Yamamoto's itinerary in the Solomon Islands area. The death of Yamamoto reportedly damaged the morale of Japanese naval personnel, raised the morale of the Allied forces, and was intended as revenge by U.S. leaders who blamed Yamamoto for the attack on Pearl Harbor that initiated the formal state of war between Imperial Japan and the United States. The U.S. pilots claimed to have shot down three twin-engined bombers and two fighters during the mission, but Japanese sources show only two bombers were shot down.

This event started with ISIL attacking and capturing Sinjar and neighboring towns on 3 August, during ISIL\'s offensive in early August 2014. Dr Noori Abdulrahman, head of the Department of Coordination and Follow-up of the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government, stated that ISIL\'s 3 August campaign against Sinjar was more about demography and strategy than about religion. According to Abdulrahman, ISIL wanted to push most of the Kurds out of strategic Yazidi areas and bring in Arabs, obedient to ISIL. On 8 August 2014, the United States reacted with airstrikes on ISIL units and convoys in northern Iraq, which led to a war of several countries against ISIL. The assistance of PKK and YPG enabled the majority of the 50,000 Yazidis who fled into the Sinjar Mountains to be evacuated. On 17 December 2014, the Kurdish Peshmerga, PKK and YPG forces started the December 2014 Sinjar offensive with the support of US airstrikes.

This occurred after the government claimed that it foiled an alleged coup d\'état attempt against the rule of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo earlier that same day. State security services also claimed that it had arrested a general who was involved in the coup attempt. President Arroyo lifted the state of emergency on March 3, 2006 by the virtue of Proclamation No. 1021. The state of national emergency also led to a temporary suspension of lower-level education classes and an immediate revocation on all licenses and permits to hold demonstrations and protests. The government, informally known as "Malacañang", after the presidential palace, also suspended all public activities on the same day and even on succeeding days. Under the provisions of the 1987 Constitution, the government was allowed at the moment to detain anyone indefinitely without the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. President Arroyo assured Filipinos that the situation was under control and the state of emergency would not be abused. Arroyo had justified the declaration of a state of emergency with her statement of "clear and present danger to our Republic that we have discovered and thwarted." Critics claimed that this was an attempt by Arroyo to seize political power due to her sagging influence and popularity, and some drew similarities to the actions of her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, when he declared martial law in 1972.

The sixth named storm of the 1985–86 Australian region cyclone season, Winifred originated as a tropical low north of Cairns, Queensland on 27 January 1986. Slowly organizing, the system was recognized as a tropical cyclone after gaining tropical characteristics on 30 January, christened with the name Winifred the same day. Meandering southward, the cyclone began to curve southeastward that evening before suddenly turning toward the coast, southwestward, on 31 January, steadily intensifying in that time. By the time it came ashore near Silkwood, Queensland at 0445 UTC on 1 February, it was producing Category 3-force winds on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 957 mbar (28.38 inHg). Weakening as it drifted inland, Winifred persisted as a tropical depression for another five days after landfall before finally dissipating on 5 February. In advance of Winifred\'s approach, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone watches and warnings for various locations along the Queensland coast, prompting evacuations in several towns. Damage after landfall was widespread and severe, with thousands of homes damaged, flooding as a result of heavy rainfall along major rivers, and severe damage to crops. Debris obstructed roads across northern Queensland and power outages disrupted electrical service, even at water treatment plants, forcing officials to warn residents to boil water as a precautionary measure. Overall, the cyclone caused $86.4 million in agriculture-related damages, with sugar cane and banana harvests suffering the most. Tourist operations were generally uninterrupted by the storm, while ecological and environmental damage, if any, was mild. Even so, high winds uprooted trees in wide swaths of forests, with those not completely defoliated. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and inflicted $130 million (1986 AUD; $154 million USD) in damage. In the aftermath of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department of Social Security (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth of Australia initiated a three-year, $150 million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion in the days following the cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns.

The storm formed near the coast of Africa on September 9, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, before making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Long Island on September 21. It is estimated that the hurricane killed 682 people, damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at $306 million ($4.7 billion in 2017). Damaged trees and buildings were still seen in the affected areas as late as 1951. It remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane in recorded New England history, perhaps eclipsed in landfall intensity only by the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635. At the time, roughly half of the 1938 New England hurricane's existence went unnoticed. The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in 2013 concluded that the storm developed into a tropical depression on September 9 off the coast of West Africa, but the United States Weather Bureau was unaware that a tropical cyclone existed until September 16; by then, it was already a well-developed hurricane and had tracked westward toward the Sargasso Sea. It reached hurricane strength on September 15 and continued to strengthen to a peak intensity of 160 mph (260 km/h) near the Bahamas four days later, making it a Category 5-equivalent hurricane. The storm was propelled northward, rapidly paralleling the East Coast before making landfalls on Long Island and Connecticut as a Category 3-equivalent hurricane on September 21. After moving inland, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated over Ontario on September 23.\nevents: t0: 1938, t1: September 9, t2: September 21, t3: 1951, t4: 1635, t5: 1938, t6: 2013, t7: September 9, t8: September 16, t9: September 15, t10: September 21, t11: September 23, t12: 2017, e0: Hurricane, e1: Hurricane, e2: cyclones, e3: strike, e4: storm, e5: formed, e6: hurricane, e7: landfall, e8: hurricane, e9: hurricane, e10: killed, e11: damaged, e12: destroyed, e13: caused, e14: losses, e15: Damaged, e16: seen, e17: hurricane, e18: eclipsed, e19: concluded, e20: storm, e21: developed, e22: depression, e23: cyclone, e24: hurricane, e25: tracked, e26: strengthen, e27: hurricane, e28: storm, e29: propelled, e30: landfalls, e31: hurricane, e32: moving, e33: transitioned, e34: cyclone, e35: dissipated\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The bridge—designed by Sir Thomas Bouch—used lattice girders supported by iron piers, with cast iron columns and wrought iron cross-bracing. The piers were narrower and their cross-bracing was less extensive and robust than on previous similar designs by Bouch. Bouch had sought expert advice on wind loading when designing a proposed rail bridge over the Firth of Forth; as a result of that advice he had made no explicit allowance for wind loading in the design of the Tay Bridge. There were other flaws in detailed design, in maintenance, and in quality control of castings, all of which were, at least in part, Bouch's responsibility. Bouch died within the year, his reputation ruined. Future British bridge designs had to allow for wind loadings of up to .

It was held in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl, and in Houston, at either the Astrodome or the Rice Stadium on the campus of Rice University. The original Texxas Jam was a three-day festival held over July 4 weekend in 1978 and encompassed rock and country. Texxas Jam was created by Louis Messina, promoter of Pace Concerts in Houston, and David Krebs, manager of the rock acts Ted Nugent and Aerosmith. Krebs wanted to duplicate the music festival California Jam II (held March 18, 1978 in Ontario, California) in Texas. Krebs was unfamiliar with the territory, so he contacted Messina in Houston. A book, "Texxas Jam: 1978–1988," was published in March 2011 covering all 11 Texxas Jams. Notes: Ted Nugent joined Aerosmith on stage for a rousing rendition of "Milk Cow Blues". For comic relief, Cheech & Chong entertained the crowd between a couple of acts. The temperature reached 104 degrees that day (over 120 degrees on the field). To protect the Cotton Bowl, they covered the surface with black tarps. Over 100,000 people were in attendance on the hottest day of the decade. The concert had hose sprinklers around the field edge to cool people off, and they hosed the crowd down with firehoses from the stage. First aid stations were busy. Artists who performed at the Texxas Jam. This was the first southern stadium rock show since ZZ Top played to 80,000 people at UT Austin on September 1, 1974 and tore up the field. In the aftermath of the ZZ Top UT show there was never supposed to be another stadium rock show in Texas again, an informal prohibition that lasted all of four years. Notes: The order of appearance on this bill was TKO/Hagar/Nazareth/Van Halen/Boston/Heart/BOC. Blue Oyster Cult headlined this show. TKO was managed by the same management as Heart at the time, which is the reason for their appearance on the bill. KTXQ-FM Q-102 simulcast much of this concert throughout the day, with TKO, Hagar, Nazareth, and portions of Heart\'s show aired live. Van Halen\'s set was not broadcast, and KTXQ had to unplug their sound equipment for Boston\'s set, which they did before Heart took the stage. As a result, only a portion of Heart\'s set was aired, the sound being broadcast from microphones placed around the Cotton Bowl. Officially called "The Last Concert of the Last Weekend of the Last Summer of the Seventies",  Note: Rush performed pre-studio versions of "The Spirit of Radio" and "Freewill". Notes: Savvy was bumped at the last minute by The Eagles management. Show lineup confirmed by Steve Jones of Savvy. Christopher Cross, who already didn\'t fit on the hard rocking Texxas Jam stage, was resoundingly booed at the outset of "Sailing", then later cut his set short after throwing up on stage due to heat exhaustion. The Eagles refused to play at first and were an hour late going on due to issues with the \'Hard Rock\' line up. Notes: Savvy was originally scheduled to open, but was bumped by REO Speedwagon\'s management (same management as The Eagles in 1980). Show lineup confirmed by Steve Jones of Savvy. Notes: The 81\' Jam was only held in Houston that year because of the intense Summer heat in Tx. The decided to just have it at the Astrodome. Turned out to not be as successful as they hoped. Was moved back to Dallas in 82\'  Notes: The order of appearance was La Roux, Ozzy Osbourne, Loverboy, and then Foreigner. Notes: Ozzy had a shaved head and black makeup around his eyes – from a distance, it looked like a skull. Notes: It was a hot day that day. Sammy Hagar had a guitar stolen backstage at the Cotton Bowl show; it was returned later that day. However, Hagar vowed to never play it again after it had been handled by someone else, and lit it on fire on stage. Right before Santana\'s set the house music mix played their hit "Winning", the lead singer and other band members came onstage and motioned to the sound mixers to try to get the song cut off, afterwards the band did not play "Winning" during their set. Correction: Sammy\'s guitar was stolen from a previous Dallas show. Was recovered and Sammy held it until the Texxas Jam. Where he explained the incident and destroyed the guitar  The guitar was never set on fire. Sammy smashed the guitar onstage and threw it into the crowd. Notes: Sammy came on right before Styx at the end. Ted Nugent and Rik Emmett joined Sammy Hagar on stage in Dallas for their version of Led Zeppelin\'s "Rock "n Roll." Tommy Shaw recalls these shows as being some of the worst of his career. He claims to have feared for his life as his band was performing nothing but the rock opera "Killroy was here" after some of the best hard rock bands of the day had performed. (This was the tour that essentially ended Styx.) Notes: Bryan Adams\' drummer for this show was Matt Frenette of Loverboy. Notes: Leslie West joined BTO on stage to perform Mountain\'s "Mississippi Queen." Notes: The live concert footage for Poison\'s video "I Won\'t Forget You" was filmed at this performance. The crowd seemed wild about Poison while in actuality a drunk concert goer was on top of a lighting tower (about 30\' up) trampolining on the tarp roof in nothing but a pair of blue jeans. The crowd really enjoyed him and the Dallas PD\'s attempt to get him safely to the ground. Also, Poison was joined onstage by Paul Stanley for their performance of KISS\' "Strutter". The temperature in Dallas that day reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit, prompting many in the very crowded ground area to pass out and be lifted overhead to the indoor areas of the stadium where water fountains were at. Water from hoses was also sprayed on the concertgoers in the field. Notes: Metallica played "Harvester of Sorrow" for the first time live. Van Halen\'s Sammy Hagar lost his voice after only a couple of songs. He then promised to play a free show in Dallas.

They burned part of the town and killed 47 villagers. The raiders left with 112 settlers as captives, whom they took overland the nearly 300 miles to Montreal. Some died along the way, and 60 were later redeemed (ransomed by family and community). Others were adopted by Mohawk families and became assimilated into the tribe. In this period, the English and their Indian allies were involved in similar raids against French villages along the northern area between the spheres of influence. Typical of the small-scale frontier conflict in Queen Anne\'s War, the French-led raid relied on a coalition of French soldiers and a variety of about 300 Indian warriors, mostly Abenaki but including a number of Pocumtuc who had once lived in the Deerfield area. Given the diversity of personnel, motivations, and material objectives, the raiders did not achieve full surprise when they entered the palisaded village. The defenders of some fortified houses in the village successfully held off the raiders until arriving reinforcements prompted their retreat. However, the raid was a clear victory for the French coalition that aimed to take captives and unsettle English colonial frontier society. More than 100 captives were taken, and about 40 percent of the village houses were destroyed. Although predicted because of existing tensions during the war, the raid shocked New England colonists. Conflict increased with the French and their Native American allies. Frontier settlements took actions to fortify their towns and prepare for war. The raid has been immortalized as a part of the early American frontier story, principally due to the published account by a prominent captive, the Rev. John Williams. He and much of his family were taken on the long overland journey to Canada. His young daughter Eunice was adopted by a Mohawk family; she became assimilated and married a Mohawk man. Williams\' account, "The Redeemed Captive", was published in 1707 and was widely popular in the colonies.\nevents: t0: 1704, t1: February 29, t2: 1707, e0: occurred, e1: attacked, e2: burned, e3: killed, e4: left, e5: took, e6: died, e7: adopted, e8: became, e9: involved, e10: conflict, e11: raid, e12: achieve, e13: entered, e14: held off, e15: retreat, e16: raid, e17: aimed, e18: take captives, e19: taken, e20: destroyed, e21: predicted, e22: raid, e23: shocked, e24: increased, e25: prepare, e26: raid, e27: immortalized, e28: adopted, e29: became, e30: married, e31: published\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The two venues were the Halifax Metro Centre and the Colisée Pepsi. The tournament was won by Russia which claimed its first gold medal since 1993. It was the 72nd IIHF World Championship event, and was run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). It was the first time the final tournament is held in a non-European country since 1962, when it was held in Colorado, USA. The IIHF wanted to celebrate the federation\'s 100th anniversary by holding the tournament in the country where ice hockey was born. The tournament was also included as part of the celebrations of Quebec City\'s 400th anniversary. The tournament featured many countries\' elite stars, as it served as the last and most important stage in selecting nine automatic qualifiers for the men\'s hockey competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a process that uses the IIHF World Ranking standings after the tournament. On May 8, 2007, the IIHF announced it "will also formalize the Triple Gold Club by awarding commemorative medals to the 19 players who have won the three most prestigious championships in world hockey: Olympic gold, Stanley Cup, and World Championship gold. The ceremony will take place in Canada during the 2008 World Championship." There were two changes in the format compared to earlier years. Because of the distance between Halifax and Quebec City, the quarter-finals were played within the group, instead of crossing over which has happened since 2000. The relegation round was different too, as it consisted of two best-of-three series instead of a round robin series between four teams. For the first time in 40 years, the matches were played on smaller, NHL size rinks, 200 ft × 85 ft (roughly 61 m × 26 m), compared to the IIHF standard which is roughly 200 ft × 98.5 ft (61 m × 30 m).\nevents: t0: May 2, t1: May 18, t2: 2008, t3: 1993, t4: May 8 , 2007, t5: 2000, t6: 1962, t7: 40 years, t8: earlier years, t9: 2010, t10: 2008, e0: played, e1: claimed, e2: run, e3: held, e4: held, e5: celebrate, e6: holding, e7: served, e8: selecting, e9: uses, e10: announced, e11: formalize, e12: awarding, e13: take place, e14: changes, e15: played, e16: happened, e17: matches\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It took place near Charleston, South Carolina, during the first British attempt to capture the city from American forces. It is also sometimes referred to as the First Siege of Charleston, owing to a more successful British siege in 1780. The British organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of North America. Delayed by logistical concerns and bad weather, the expedition reached the coast of North Carolina in May 1776. Finding conditions unsuitable for their operations, General Henry Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charlestown. Arriving there in early June, troops were landed on Long Island (now called Isle of Palms), near Sullivan's Island where Colonel William Moultrie commanded a partially constructed fort, in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault.

The coup failed and the rebellion developed into an ethnic conflict between the Gaelic Irish and old English Catholics on one side, and both ethnically English Protestants and Scottish/Presbyterian planters on the other. This began a conflict known as the Irish Confederate Wars. The rising was sparked by Catholic fears of an impending invasion of Ireland by anti-Catholic forces of the English Long Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the authority of King Charles I (king of England, Scotland, and Ireland). In turn, the rebels\' suspected association with Charles helped start the English Civil War. The English and Scottish Parliaments refused to raise an army to put down the rebellion unless it was under their command rather than the King\'s. The Irish rebellion broke out in October 1641 and was followed by several months of violent chaos before the Irish Catholic upper classes and clergy formed the Catholic Confederation in the summer of 1642. The Confederation became a de facto government of most of Ireland, free from the control of the English administration and loosely aligned with the Royalist side in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The subsequent Irish Confederate Wars continued in Ireland until the 1650s, when Oliver Cromwell\'s New Model Army decisively defeated the Irish Catholics and Royalists, and re-conquered the country. The 1641 Irish Rebellion is seen as a key event in the mid-17th century collapse of the Stuart monarchy.\nevents: t0: 1641, t1: October 1641, t2: the summer of 1642, t3: the 1650s, t4: 1641, t5: the mid-17th century, t6: several months, e0: began, e1: seize, e2: control, e3: force, e4: developed, e5: conflict, e6: began, e7: conflict, e8: rising, e9: sparked, e10: fears, e11: invasion, e12: defying, e13: suspected, e14: helped, e15: start, e16: refused, e17: raise, e18: command, e19: broke out, e20: formed, e21: became, e22: free, e23: control, e24: aligned, e25: defeated, e26: seen, e27: collapse\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It followed "Operation Ivy" and preceded "Operation Castle". Over 21,000 soldiers took part in the ground exercise Desert Rock V in conjunction with the "Grable" shot. "Grable" was a 280mm AFAP shell fired from the "Atomic Cannon" and was viewed by a number of high-ranking military officials. The test series was notable as containing the first time an Artillery Fired Atomic Projectile AFAP artillery shell was fired ("GRABLE" Shot), the first two shots (both fizzles) by University of California Radiation Laboratory—Livermore (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and for testing out some of the thermonuclear components that would be used for the massive thermonuclear series of Operation Castle. One primary device (RACER) was tested in thermonuclear system mockup assemblies of TX-14, TX-16, and TX-17/TX-24, to examine and evaluate the behaviour of radiation cases and the compression of the secondary geometries by the primary\'s x-rays prior to full-scale testing during Castle. Following RACER\'s dodgy performance, the COBRA primary was used in the emergency capability ALARM CLOCK, JUGHEAD, RUNT I, RUNT II thermonuclear devices, as well as in the SHRIMP device.

The producer was Alex Garnizov. The program was born in Moscow in December 1998. The official premiere of the show was held in St. Petersburg, in March 1999 in Oktyabrskiy Big Concert Hall. It was a super-show based on the songs of the Moscow composer Vladimir Evzerov. The format was different from past shows of the singer, so that the actor had decided to use laser pyrotechnics, that decorate the program. In the form of decorations on the stage, there were three huge screens, framed by intricate attributes, thereby giving the camera view. On the screens were shown scenes of the songs. During the song "Santa Barbara", flashed the endless waters of the Pacific Ocean. At the "Coco Chanel", appeared in Mademoiselle herself, surrounded by the sights of Paris, but to the song "Queen destiny", the entire screen appeared as the face of the singer, prompting a storm of enthusiasm in the hall. It is said that the sole sponsor of all, was Leontiev himself. After the premiere show in Moscow, "Photographer of Dreams" rolled off the cities of Russia and Ukraine, visited Germany, the US and Israel. Everywhere, the audience was a full house. The TV version held on ORT Channel on 27 March 1999. In 1999, the Prize "Ovation" was awarded to the program for best show of the year.

A subsequent investigation by the Chinese authorities found that the plant had been lacking many major safety features and was severely below regulation benchmarks, with the direct cause of the accident being attributed to inappropriate use of substandard equipment. The investigation also concluded that the various other safety failings at the facility were contributing factors.

He targeted French Army soldiers as well as children and teachers at a Jewish school. Seven people were killed and five wounded. On 11 March, Merah shot dead an off-duty French Army paratrooper in Toulouse. On 15 March, he killed two off-duty uniformed French soldiers and seriously wounded another in Montauban. On 19 March, he opened fire at the Ozar Hatorah Jewish day school in Toulouse, killing a rabbi and three children, also wounding four others. Merah filmed his attacks with a body-worn camera. Thereafter, France raised its "Vigipirate," the terror alert system, to the highest level in the Midi-Pyrénées region and surrounding departements. The United Nations, many governments around the world and the French Council of the Muslim Faith condemned the attacks. The gunman, Mohammed Merah, was a 23-year-old French petty criminal of Algerian descent who was born and raised in Toulouse. He claimed allegiance to Al-Qaeda and said he carried out his attacks because of France\'s participation in the War in Afghanistan and its ban on Islamic face veils, and justified his attack on the Jewish school because "The Jews kill our brothers and sisters in Palestine". He was killed on 22 March by a police tactical unit after a 30-hour siege at his rented apartment there, during which he wounded six agents.

In a broader sense, one can view the Georgian–Abkhaz conflict as part of a geopolitical conflict in the Caucasus region, intensified at the end of the 20th century with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The conflict, one of the bloodiest in the post-Soviet area, remains unresolved. The Georgian government has offered substantial autonomy to Abkhazia several times. However, both the Abkhaz government and the opposition in Abkhazia refuse any form of union with Georgia. Abkhaz regard their independence as the result of a war of liberation from Georgia, while Georgians believe that historically Abkhazia has always formed part of Georgia. Georgians formed the single largest ethnic group in pre-war Abkhazia, with a 45.7% plurality as of 1989 but most Georgians left in Abkhazia want to remain independent of Georgia. Many accuse the government of Eduard Shevardnadze (in office 1992-2003) of the initiation of senseless hostilities, and then of ineffective conduct of the war and post-war diplomacy. During the war the Abkhaz separatist side carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign which resulted in the expulsion of up to 250,000 ethnic Georgians and in the killing of from 4,000 to 15,000. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) conventions of Lisbon, Budapest and Istanbul have officially recognized the ethnic cleansing of Georgians, which UN General Assembly Resolution GA/10708 also mentions.

Near the end of May 2015, fourteen people were indicted in connection with an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) into wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering. The United States Attorney General simultaneously announced the unsealing of the indictments and the prior guilty pleas by four football executives and two corporations. The investigation mostly revolved around collusion between officials of continental football bodies CONMEBOL (South America) and CONCACAF (Caribbean, Central and North America), and sports marketing executives. The sports marketing executives were holders of media and marketing rights for high-profile international competitions including the Americas' FIFA World Cup qualifying tournaments, and showpiece tournaments CONCACAF Gold Cup and Copa América. CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb, also serving president of the Cayman Islands Football Association, was arrested in connection with the investigation, as were two sitting FIFA Executive Committee members: Eduardo Li of the Costa Rican Football Federation and Eugenio Figueredo, formerly of the Uruguayan Football Association, and former CONMEBOL President Nicolás Leoz. The investigation lasted several years, with the first arrest, of former CONCACAF president Jack Warner's son Daryll, made in July 2013. In total, seven current FIFA officials were arrested at the Hotel Baur au Lac in Zürich on 27 May. They were preparing to attend the 65th FIFA Congress, which was scheduled to include the election of the president of FIFA. They are expected to be extradited to the United States on suspicion of receiving in bribes. There was also a simultaneous raid on the CONCACAF headquarters in Miami, and later, two further men handed themselves in to police for arrest: Jack Warner and marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco. Two further arrests of FIFA officials at the hotel occurred in December 2015. The arrests case triggered Australia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany and Switzerland to open or intensify separate criminal investigations into top FIFA officials for corruption.\nevents: t0: 2015, t1: may 2015, t2: July 2013, t3: 27 May, t4: December 2015, t5: several years, e0: disclosed, e1: connected, e2: governing, e3: end, e4: indicted, e5: investigation, e6: service, e7: investigation, e8: announced, e9: indictments, e10: pleas, e11: investigation, e12: revolved, e13: collusion, e14: competitions, e15: tournaments, e16: tournaments, e17: serving, e18: arrested, e19: investigation, e20: investigation, e21: arrest, e22: made, e23: arrested, e24: preparing, e25: attend, e26: scheduled, e27: election, e28: extradited, e29: receiving, e30: raid, e31: handed, e32: arrest, e33: arrests, e34: occurred, e35: arrests, e36: triggered, e37: open, e38: intensify, e39: investigations\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Riding from the steppes of Central Asia, the Seljuq replicated tactics practiced by the Huns hundreds of years earlier against a similar Roman opponent but now combining it with new-found Islamic zeal; in many ways, the Seljuq resumed the conquests of the Muslims in the Byzantine–Arab Wars initiated by the Rashidun, Umayyad and Abassid Caliphate in the Levant, North Africa and Asia Minor. Today, the Battle of Manzikert is widely seen as the moment when the Byzantines lost the war against the Turks; however the Byzantine military was of questionable quality before 1071 with regular Turkish incursions overrunning the failing theme system. Even after Manzikert, Byzantine rule over Asia Minor did not end immediately, nor were any heavy concessions levied by the Turks on their opponents – it took another 20 years before the Turks were in control of the entire Anatolian peninsula and not for long either. During the course of the war, the Seljuq Turks and their allies attacked the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, capturing Jerusalem and catalyzing the call for the First Crusade. Crusader assistance to the Byzantine Empire was mixed with treachery and looting, although substantial gains were made in the First Crusade. Within a hundred years of Manzikert, the Byzantines had successfully driven back the Turks from the coasts of Asia Minor and extended their influence right down to Palestine and even Egypt. Later, the Byzantines were unable to extract any more assistance, and the Fourth Crusade even led to the sack of Constantinople. Before the conflict petered out, the Seljuqs managed to take more territory from the weakened Empire of Nicaea until the Sultanate itself was taken over by the Mongols, leading to the rise of the ghazis and the conclusive Byzantine–Ottoman wars.\nevents: t0: Today, t1: 1071, t2: 20 years, t3: a hundred years, t4: The Byzantine–Seljuq Wars, e0: battles, e1: shifted, e2: practiced, e3: combining, e4: resumed, e5: conquests, e6: initiated, e7: Battle, e8: seen, e9: lost, e10: overrunning, e11: end, e12: levied, e13: took, e14: control, e15: attacked, e16: capturing, e17: catalyzing, e18: mixed, e19: looting, e20: gains, e21: made, e22: driven, e23: extended, e24: extract, e25: led to, e26: conflict, e27: taken over, e28: leading to, e29: rise, e30: wars\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The French Navy sought to disrupt British trade by intercepting and capturing merchant ships with roving frigates, a strategy countered by protecting British convoys with heavier warships, particularly in European waters. On 5 May 1794, the British escorts of a convoy from Cork sighted two French ships approaching and gave chase. The ships, a frigate and a corvette, outmatched by their opponents, separated and the convoy escorts did likewise, each following one of the raiders on a separate course. By the evening one of the French ships had successfully escaped, but the other was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of "Atalante" attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came within range of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS "Swiftsure" and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds. In the aftermath of the engagement, a French battle squadron that formed part of the developing Atlantic campaign of May 1794 pursued both ships for the rest of the day; their quarry eventually escaped after dark. "Atalante" was later taken into the Royal Navy as HMS "Espion".\nevents: t0: 7 May 1794, t1: 5 May 1794, t2: two days, t3: May 1794, e0: fought, e1: Wars, e2: disrupt, e3: intercepting, e4: capturing, e5: countered, e6: sighted, e7: approaching, e8: chase, e9: separated, e10: following, e11: escaped, e12: pursuit, e13: attempting, e14: drive, e15: chase, e16: came, e17: defence, e18: forced, e19: surrender, e20: suffering, e21: casualties, e22: surrendered, e23: praised, e24: defending, e25: aftermath, e26: engagement, e27: formed, e28: developing, e29: campaign, e30: pursued, e31: escaped, e32: taken\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Four people were killed: an Iraqi-born British tourist named Saad al-Hilli, 50; his wife Iqbal, 47; her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, who held a Swedish passport; and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45. The al-Hillis\' two daughters both survived the attack. One, aged four, was hidden under the legs of her dead mother in the rear footwell for eight hours even while the gendarmerie were on the scene; she was only discovered by specialist forensic investigators. The elder daughter, aged seven, was shot in the shoulder and also suffered a head wound; she returned to the United Kingdom on 14 September 2012. Police investigated al-Hilli\'s past in Iraq as an engineer on sensitive topics, as well as his work at the time of his death, as a potential motive for the attack. Al-Hilli\'s work in the UK involved nuclear and satellite technology, whilst Mollier was also probed to determine if he was the primary target of the attack. The attack has been compared to the 1952 killing of biochemist Jack Drummond in the Dominici Affair. In September 2017, after 5 years of investigation, French police said they had "no working theory" to explain the murders and no suspects.

The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was carried out in a CIA-led operation with Joint Special Operations Command, commonly known as JSOC, coordinating the Special Mission Units involved in the raid. In addition to SEAL Team Six, participating units under JSOC included the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)—also known as "Night Stalkers"—and operators from the CIA\'s Special Activities Division, which recruits heavily from former JSOC Special Mission Units. The operation ended a nearly 10-year search for bin Laden, following his role in the September 11 attacks on the United States. The raid on bin Laden\'s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. U.S. military officials said that after the raid U.S. forces took the body of bin Laden to Afghanistan for identification, then buried it at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition. Al-Qaeda confirmed the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. The raid was supported by over 90% of the American public, was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and a large number of governments, but was condemned by others, including two-thirds of the Pakistani public. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden\'s death to the public. In the aftermath of the killing, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani formed a commission under Senior Justice Javed Iqbal to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack. The resulting Abbottabad Commission Report, which revealed Pakistani state military and intelligence authorities\' "collective failure" that enabled bin Laden to hide in Pakistan for nine years, was leaked to Al Jazeera on July 8, 2013.\nevents: t0: September 11, t1: 24 hours, t2: May 6, t3: july 8 , 2013, t4: 10-year, t5: nine years, t6: May 2 , 2011, e0: killed, e1: operation, e2: code-named, e3: operation, e4: carried out, e5: operation, e6: joint, e7: command, e8: coordinating, e9: raid, e10: participating, e11: recruits, e12: operation, e13: ended, e14: search, e15: attacks, e16: raid, e17: launched, e18: said, e19: raid, e20: took, e21: identification, e22: buried, e23: death, e24: confirmed, e25: death, e26: vowing, e27: avenge, e28: killing, e29: vowed, e30: retaliation, e31: preventing, e32: operation, e33: raid, e34: supported, e35: condemned, e36: killing, e37: taken, e38: unarmed, e39: questioned, e40: decision, e41: release, e42: death, e43: killing, e44: formed, e45: investigate, e46: attack, e47: revealed, e48: enabled, e49: hide, e50: leaked\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It is called the Secret War among the CIA Special Activities Division and Hmong veterans of the conflict. The Kingdom of Laos was a covert theater for other belligerents during the Vietnam War. The Franco–Lao Treaty of Amity and Association (signed 22 October 1953) transferred remaining French powers to the Royal Lao Government (except control of military affairs), establishing Laos as an independent member of the French Union. However, this government did not include representatives from the Lao Issara anti-colonial armed nationalist movement. The following years were marked by a rivalry between the neutralists under Prince Souvanna Phouma, the right wing under Prince Boun Oum of Champassak, and the left-wing Lao Patriotic Front under Prince Souphanouvong and half-Vietnamese future Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane. Several attempts were made to establish coalition governments, and a "tri-coalition" government was finally seated in Vientiane. The actual fighting in Laos involved the North Vietnamese Army, U.S. troops and Thai forces and South Vietnamese army forces directly and through irregular proxies in a struggle for control over the Laotian Panhandle. The North Vietnamese Army occupied the area to use for its Ho Chi Minh Trail supply corridor and as staging area for offensives into South Vietnam. There was a second major theater of action on and near the northern Plain of Jars. The North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao eventually emerged victorious in 1975, as part of the general communist victory in all of former French Indochina that year. A total of up to 300,000 people from Laos fled to neighboring Thailand following the Pathet Lao takeover. After the communists took power in Laos, Hmong rebels fought the new government. The Hmong were persecuted as traitors and "lackeys" of the Americans, with the government and its Vietnamese allies carrying out human rights abuses against Hmong civilians. The incipient conflict between Vietnam and China also played a role with Hmong rebels being accused of receiving support from China. Over 40,000 people died in the conflict. The Lao royal family were arrested by the Pathet Lao after the war and sent to labor camps, where most of them died in the late 1970s and 1980s, including King Savang Vatthana, Queen Khamphoui, and Crown Prince Vong Savang.\nevents: t0: 1959–75, t1: 23 May 1959, t2: 2 December 1975, t3: 22 october 1953, t4: 1975, t5: 1980s, t6: The following years, e0: war, e1: fought, e2: associated, e3: receiving, e4: war, e5: called, e6: signed, e7: transferred, e8: control, e9: establishing, e10: marked, e11: made, e12: establish, e13: seated, e14: struggle, e15: control, e16: occupied, e17: use, e18: emerged, e19: fled, e20: took, e21: fought, e22: persecuted, e23: carrying out, e24: accused, e25: receiving, e26: died, e27: arrested, e28: war, e29: sent, e30: died\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The South Eastern Railway Folkestone to London boat train derailed while crossing a viaduct where a length of track had been removed during engineering works, killing ten passengers and injuring forty. In the Board of Trade report it was found that a man had been placed with a red flag away but the regulations required him to be away and the train had insufficient time to stop. Charles Dickens was travelling with Ellen Ternan and her mother on the train; they all survived the derailment. He tended the victims, some of whom died while he was with them. The experience affected Dickens greatly; he lost his voice for two weeks and afterwards was nervous when travelling by train, using alternative means when available.

On the plane was the Manchester United football team, nicknamed the "Busby Babes", along with supporters and journalists. Twenty of the 44 on the aircraft died at the scene. The injured, some unconscious, were taken to the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich where three more died, resulting in 23 fatalities with 21 survivors. The team was returning from a European Cup match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, having eliminated Red Star Belgrade to advance to the semi-finals of the competition. The flight stopped to refuel in Munich because a non-stop flight from Belgrade to Manchester was beyond the "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador\'s range. After refuelling, pilots James Thain and Kenneth Rayment twice abandoned take-off because of boost surging in the left engine. Fearing they would get too far behind schedule, Captain Thain rejected an overnight stay in Munich in favour of a third take-off attempt. By then, snow was falling, causing a layer of slush to form at the end of the runway. After the aircraft hit the slush, it ploughed through a fence beyond the end of the runway and the left wing was torn off after hitting a house. Fearing the aircraft might explode, Thain began evacuating passengers while Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg helped pull survivors from the wreckage. An investigation by West German airport authorities originally blamed Thain, saying he did not de-ice the aircraft\'s wings, despite eyewitness statements to the contrary. It was later established that the crash was caused by the slush on the runway, which slowed the plane too much to take off. Thain was cleared in 1968, ten years after the incident. Manchester United were trying to become the third club to win three successive English league titles; they were six points behind League leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers with 14 games to go. They also held the Charity Shield and had just advanced into their second successive European Cup semi-finals. The team had not been beaten for 11 matches. The crash not only derailed their title ambitions that year but also virtually destroyed the nucleus of what promised to be one of the greatest generations of players in English football history. It took 10 years for the club to recover, with Busby rebuilding the team and winning the European Cup in 1968 with a new generation of "Babes".\nevents: t0: 6 February 1958, t1: 1968, t2: 10 years, t3: 1968, t4: ten years, t5: that year, e0: disaster, e1: occurred, e2: crashed, e3: take off, e4: nicknamed, e5: died, e6: injured, e7: taken, e8: died, e9: resulting in, e10: fatalities, e11: returning, e12: match, e13: eliminated, e14: advance, e15: semi-finals, e16: competition, e17: stopped, e18: abandoned, e19: take-off, e20: surging, e21: get, e22: rejected, e23: stay, e24: take-off, e25: falling, e26: causing, e27: form, e28: hit, e29: ploughed, e30: torn, e31: hitting, e32: explode, e33: began, e34: evacuating, e35: helped, e36: investigation, e37: blamed, e38: saying, e39: statements, e40: established, e41: crash, e42: caused, e43: slowed, e44: take off, e45: incident, e46: become, e47: win, e48: games, e49: held, e50: advanced, e51: semi-finals, e52: beaten, e53: matches, e54: crash, e55: derailed, e56: destroyed, e57: promised, e58: took, e59: recover, e60: rebuilding, e61: winning\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It is also called the Jacobite War in Ireland or the Williamite–Jacobite War in Ireland. The proximate cause of the war was the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in which James, a Catholic, was overthrown as king of the Three Kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary and nephew and son-in-law William, ruling as joint monarchs. James\'s supporters initially retained control of Ireland, which he hoped to use as a base for a campaign to reclaim all three kingdoms; however, the conflict in Ireland also involved longstanding domestic issues of land ownership and religious and civic rights, and many Irish Catholics supported James in the hope he would address their grievances. A small number of English and Scottish Catholics, and Protestants of the established Church in Ireland, also fought on the Jacobite side, while many Irish Protestants supported or actively fought for William’s regime. While the war\'s Irish name emphasises its aspect as a domestic conflict between James and William, some contemporaries and many modern commentators have viewed it as part of a wider European conflict known as the Nine Years\' War or War of the Grand Alliance in which William, as Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, led a multi-national coalition against France under Louis XIV. William’s deposition of James was partly driven by his need to control and mobilise English military and commercial power, while Louis provided limited material support to the Jacobites: both sides were aware of the Irish war\'s potential to divert military resources from the Continent. The war began with a series of skirmishes between James’s Irish Army, which had stayed loyal in 1688, and militia forces raised by Irish Protestants: they culminated in the Siege of Derry, where the Jacobites failed to regain control of one of the north’s key towns. William landed a force including English, Scottish, Dutch, Danish and other troops to put down Jacobite resistance. James left Ireland after a reverse at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, as did William after a successful Jacobite defence of Limerick; the remaining Jacobite forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691, and negotiated terms in the Treaty of Limerick. A contemporary witness, George Story, calculated that the war had claimed 100,000 lives through sickness, famine, and in battle. Subsequent Jacobite risings were confined to Scotland and England, but the war was to have a lasting effect on the political and cultural landscape of Ireland, confirming British and Protestant rule over the country for over two centuries. While the Treaty of Limerick had offered a series of guarantees to Catholics, subsequent extension of the Penal Laws, particularly during the War of the Spanish Succession, would further erode their civic rights. The Williamite victories at Derry and the Boyne are still celebrated by some, mostly Ulster Protestant, unionists in Ireland today.\nevents: t0: 1688–1691, t1: 1688, t2: 1690, t3: 1691, t4: 1688, t5: two centuries, e0: conflict, e1: called, e2: overthrown, e3: replaced, e4: retained, e5: supported, e6: address, e7: established, e8: fought, e9: supported, e10: fought, e11: viewed, e12: driven, e13: control, e14: provided, e15: support, e16: aware, e17: began, e18: stayed, e19: raised, e20: culminated, e21: failed, e22: regain, e23: left, e24: defeated, e25: negotiated, e26: claimed, e27: confined, e28: confirming, e29: offered, e30: erode, e31: celebrated\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The event coincided with similar protests organized in various cities across the nation. The protesters rallied against what they consider big government, the dismantling of free market capitalism, abortion, and President Barack Obama\'s proposals on health care reform, taxation, and federal spending, among other issues. The lead organizer of the event was Brendan Steinhauser, who was serving as the Director of Federal and State Campaigns for FreedomWorks. Organizers of the event included the 9-12 Project, FreedomWorks, the National Taxpayers Union, The Heartland Institute, Americans for Tax Reform, Tea Party Patriots, ResistNet and Americans for Prosperity. The event was also promoted by Fox News commentator Glenn Beck as a symbol of what he called "national unity" following the eight-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The march is the largest gathering of fiscal conservatives ever held in Washington, D.C., as well as the largest demonstration against President Obama\'s administration. A wide range of crowd estimates was suggested for the event, with most media sourcing the Public Information Officer of the D.C. Fire Department, who unofficially estimated the attendance "in excess of 75,000" people. The D.C. Fire Department later released a statement saying that they do not do crowd estimates, and any crowd estimation attributed to them was false; they also stated that an early estimate of 60,000 over Twitter was for a specific area, Freedom Plaza, not the total number of participants in the event. Event organizers also reported a range of attendance. FreedomWorks suggested between 600,000 and 800,000 participants while National Taxpayers Union said 200,000 to 300,000.\nevents: t0: september 12 , 2009, t1: eight-year, t2: September 11, e0: march, e1: held, e2: organized, e3: proposals, e4: spending, e5: serving, e6: reform, e7: promoted, e8: called, e9: attacks, e10: gathering, e11: held, e12: demonstration, e13: suggested, e14: released, e15: saying, e16: attributed, e17: stated, e18: reported, e19: suggested, e20: said\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

On 14 September 2008, the aircraft operating the flight crashed on approach to Perm International Airport at 5:10 local time (UTC+06). All 82 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. Among the passengers who were killed was Russian Colonel General Gennady Troshev formerly the commander of the North Caucasus Military District (including Chechnya) during the Second Chechen War and adviser to the President of Russia. A section of the Trans-Siberian Railway was damaged by the crash. Flight 821 is the deadliest accident involving a Boeing 737-500, surpassing the 1993 crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 733, and was the second-deadliest aviation incident in 2008, behind Spanair Flight 5022. The primary cause of the crash was that both pilots had lost spatial orientation due to their inexperience with the Western type of attitude indicator on the aircraft. Lack of adequate rest, poor crew resource management, and alcohol consumption by the captain also contributed to the accident. This air disaster led to Aeroflot-Nord rebranding as Nordavia, effective on 1 December 2009 and later to Smartavia in 2019.\nevents: t0: 14 September 2008, t1: 5:10, t2: 2008, t3: 1993, t4: 2019, t5: 1 December 2009, e0: operated, e1: agreement, e2: operating, e3: crashed, e4: approach, e5: killed, e6: killed, e7: War, e8: damaged, e9: crash, e10: accident, e11: involving, e12: surpassing, e13: crash, e14: incident, e15: cause, e16: crash, e17: lost, e18: management, e19: consumption, e20: contributed, e21: accident, e22: disaster, e23: led to, e24: rebranding\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The seventh named storm of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season, Greta formed from a tropical wave just northwest of Trinidad on September 13, and despite being in a climatologically unfavorable area, gradually intensified while moving west-northwestward. On September 16, it became a hurricane south of Jamaica. Two days later, the well-defined eye approached northeastern Honduras but veered to the northwest. After reaching peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) that day, Greta weakened while paralleling the northern Honduras coast just offshore. On September 19, it made landfall on Belize near Dangriga and quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. After entering the eastern Pacific, the system re-intensified into a hurricane and was renamed Olivia, which weakened before dissipating over Chiapas on September 23. Taking a similar path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta threatened to reproduce the devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200 homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roatán along the offshore Bay Islands, and there was one death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125 houses and the primary hospital. In Belize City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. Damage in Belize was estimated at $25 million (1978 USD), and there were four deaths.\nevents: t0: 1978, t1: September 13, t2: September 16, t3: Two days later, t4: September 19, t5: September 23, e0: named, e1: cross, e2: remaining, e3: named, e4: formed, e5: intensified, e6: moving, e7: became, e8: approached, e9: veered, e10: reaching, e11: made, e12: weakened, e13: crossing, e14: entering, e15: re-intensified, e16: renamed, e17: dissipating, e18: threatened, e19: devastating, e20: storm, e21: damage, e22: feared, e23: damaged, e24: damaged, e25: death, e26: downed, e27: produced, e28: flooding, e29: made, e30: damaged, e31: destroyed, e32: flipped, e33: damaged, e34: Damage\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Responsibility for the kidnappings was claimed by Boko Haram, an extremist terrorist organization based in northeastern Nigeria. 57 of the schoolgirls managed to escape over the next few months and some have described their capture in appearances at international human rights conferences. A child born to one of the girls and believed by medical personnel to be about 20 months old also was released, according to the Nigerian president's office. Since then hopes were raised on various occasions that the 219 remaining girls might be released. Newspaper reports suggested that Boko Haram was hoping to use the girls as negotiating pawns in exchange for some of their commanders in jail. In May 2016, one of the missing girls, Amina Ali, was found. She claimed that the remaining girls were still there, but that six had died. A further 21 girls were freed in October 2016, while another was rescued the next month. Another was found in January 2017. 82 more girls were freed in May 2017.

A methane explosion occurred in the mine at approximately 3:44 pm (NZDT, UTC+13). At the time of the explosion 31 miners and contractors were present in the mine. Two miners managed to walk from the mine; they were treated for moderate injuries and released from Greymouth Hospital the next day. The remaining 16 miners and 13 contractors were believed to be at least from the mine\'s entrance. Following a second explosion on 24 November at 2:37 pm, the 29 remaining men were believed by police to be dead. Police Superintendent Gary Knowles, officer in command of the rescue operation (Operation Pike) said he believed that "based on that explosion, no one survived." A third explosion occurred at 3:39 pm on 26 November 2010, and a fourth explosion occurred just before 2 pm on 28 November 2010. According to the new mine owner, Solid Energy, the bodies of the 29 miners who died there may never be recovered. The Pike River Mine incident ranks as New Zealand\'s worst mining disaster since 1914, when 43 men died at Ralph\'s Mine in Huntly. It also resulted in the country\'s worst loss of life caused by a single disaster since the 1979 crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901, although it was surpassed three months later by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. In December 2012, then Prime Minister John Key said he would apologise in person to the families of the deceased, for the Government\'s weak regulations and inadequate inspection regime. The Labour Government, elected in 2017, has established a new Pike River Recovery Agency, with re-entry expected by March 2019. It reports to the Minister Responsible for Pike River Re-entry, Andrew Little. Re-entry is expected to cost $23 million over three years. The agency took over the mine from Solid Energy, after it entered liquidation in mid-March 2018. After the re-entry, management of the mine area will return to the Department of Conservation, who are constructing a \'Pike29 Memorial Track\', in the adjacent Paparoa National Park.\nevents: t0: 19 November 2010, t1: the next day, t2: 24 November, t3: 2:37 pm, t4: 3:39 pm, t5: 26 November 2010, t6: 2 pm, t7: 28 November 2010, t8: 1914, t9: 1979, t10: february 2011, t11: December 2012, t12: 2017, t13: March 2019, t14: mid-March 2018, t15: approximately 3:44 pm ( NZDT , UTC+13 ), t16: the time, t17: three years, e0: disaster, e1: began, e2: occurred, e3: present, e4: walk, e5: treated, e6: released, e7: believed, e8: explosion, e9: believed, e10: command, e11: said, e12: believed, e13: occurred, e14: occurred, e15: died, e16: recovered, e17: ranks, e18: resulted in, e19: caused, e20: surpassed, e21: said, e22: apologise, e23: elected, e24: established, e25: reports, e26: cost, e27: took over, e28: entered, e29: return, e30: constructing\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

At that point, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway passes through a cutting on a curve. On the day of the accident, only one line was in use due to track maintenance when two trains met head-on. The drivers saw each other when they were some apart and managed to slow down so that their relative speed was under when they collided. The driver of the Glasgow train leapt clear prior to the impact and survived though badly injured, but both firemen and the driver of the other train along with 15 passengers were killed and 35 injured. One of the passengers made their way to a local home named Craigton House and commandeered a horse and cart to drive over to Linlithgow, raise the alarm and summon doctors to the scene. A special train arrived from Edinburgh bringing workmen who laboured all night to free the dead and injured, and then to clear the wreckage; indeed the line was back in use the following day. To prevent such collisions, the line was being worked by a pilot engine to escort every train through the length of single track. However, the pilot engine was being used for other duties and had waggons attached to it; moreover the distinctive small engine had been substituted for a larger one.

The airstrike occurred on 7 October 1991, as a part of a Yugoslav Air Force attack on a number of targets in the Croatian capital city. One civilian was reported killed by strafing of the Tuškanac city district and four were injured. At the time of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in the attack. In immediate aftermath, Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as "Villa Zagorje". The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995.

It failed because of the intense opposition by the aristocracy, who slaughtered up to 100,000 of the 300,000 poorly armed peasants and farmers. The survivors were fined and achieved few, if any, of their goals. The war consisted, like the preceding Bundschuh movement and the Hussite Wars, of a series of both economic and religious revolts in which peasants and farmers, often supported by Anabaptist clergy, took the lead. The German Peasants\' War was Europe\'s largest and most widespread popular uprising prior to the French Revolution of 1789. The fighting was at its height in the middle of 1525. The war began with separate insurrections, beginning in the southwestern part of what is now Germany and Alsace, and spread in subsequent insurrections to the central and eastern areas of Germany and present-day Austria. After the uprising in Germany was suppressed, it flared briefly in several Swiss Cantons. In mounting their insurrection, peasants faced insurmountable obstacles. The democratic nature of their movement left them without a command structure and they lacked artillery and cavalry. Most of them had little, if any, military experience. In combat they often turned and fled, and were massacred by their pursuers. The opposition had experienced military leaders, well-equipped and disciplined armies, and ample funding. The revolt incorporated some principles and rhetoric from the emerging Protestant Reformation, through which the peasants sought influence and freedom. Radical Reformers and Anabaptists, most famously Thomas Müntzer, instigated and supported the revolt. In contrast, Martin Luther and other Magisterial Reformers condemned it and clearly sided with the nobles. In "Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants", Luther condemned the violence as the devil\'s work and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs. Historians have interpreted the economic aspects of the German Peasants\' War differently, and social and cultural historians continue to disagree on its causes and nature.\nevents: t0: 1524, t1: 1525, t2: the middle of 1525, t3: 1789, e0: revolt, e1: slaughtered, e2: fined, e3: achieved, e4: supported, e5: took, e6: uprising, e7: revolution, e8: fighting, e9: began, e10: beginning, e11: spread, e12: suppressed, e13: flared, e14: combat, e15: turned, e16: fled, e17: well-equipped, e18: incorporated, e19: emerging, e20: supported, e21: condemned, e22: condemned, e23: called, e24: put, e25: interpreted, e26: causes\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The storm was the second-smallest tropical cyclone on record (in terms of gale-force wind diameter), behind only Tropical Storm Marco in 2008. The small, developing easterly storm had been observed passing clear of the city initially, but then turned towards it early on 24 December. After 10:00 p.m. ACST, damage became severe, and wind gusts reached before instruments failed. Residents of Darwin were celebrating Christmas, and did not immediately acknowledge the emergency, partly because they had been alerted to an earlier cyclone (Selma) that passed west of the city. Additionally, news outlets had only a skeleton crew on duty over the holiday. Tracy killed 71 people, caused 837 million in damage (1974 dollars), or approximately 6.85 billion (2018 dollars), or $4.79 billion 2018 USD. It destroyed more than 70 percent of Darwin\'s buildings, including 80 percent of houses. It left more than 25,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless prior to landfall and required the evacuation of over 30,000 people, of whom many never returned.

The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010. By 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000, although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. The nation\'s history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs, contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster. The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission\'s Chief, Hédi Annabi. Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called "Hope for Haiti Now," raising US$58 million by the next day. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince\'s morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in mass graves. As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors.\nevents: t0: 2010, t1: 16:53, t2: 21:53 UTC, t3: Tuesday , 12 January 2010, t4: 24 January, t5: 22 January, t6: 22 January, t7: the next day, e0: earthquake, e1: earthquake, e2: earthquake, e3: occurred, e4: aftershocks, e5: recorded, e6: affected, e7: quake, e8: estimates, e9: dispute, e10: estimated, e11: collapsed, e12: damaged, e13: intervention, e14: contributed, e15: increased, e16: earthquake, e17: caused, e18: damaged, e19: destroyed, e20: killed, e21: collapsed, e22: killing, e23: responded, e24: appeals, e25: pledging, e26: dispatching, e27: aired, e28: raising, e29: damaged, e30: earthquake, e31: hampered, e32: overwhelmed, e33: buried, e34: rescues, e35: became, e36: led to, e37: looting, e38: violence, e39: observed, e40: noted, e41: drawing to a close, e42: called\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It formed early on October 29 along a cold front to the southeast of the Carolinas. As it moved up the East Coast, its associated snowfall broke records in at least 20 cities for total accumulations, resulting in a rare "white Halloween" two days later. The storm arrived just two months after Hurricane Irene caused extensive power outages and property damage in the Northeast; with the 2011 New England tornado outbreak also causing damage in Western Massachusetts. It dumped snow on trees that were often still in leaf, adding extra weight, with the ground in some areas still soft from a preceding warm, rainy period that increased the possibility trees could be uprooted. Trees and branches that collapsed caused considerable damage, particularly to power lines, with estimates of storm costs ranging between $1 billion and $3 billion. In all, 3.2 million U.S. residences and businesses in 12 states experienced power outages, with the storm also impacting three Canadian provinces. Some customers in Connecticut did not get power back until early November; many outages lasted 11 days Many communities chose to postpone celebrations of Halloween from two days to a week later as a result, or cancel them entirely. Delays in restoring power led to the resignation of the chief operating officer of Connecticut Light & Power amid widespread criticism of the company\'s mishandling of both the nor\'easter and Irene.\nevents: t0: October 29, t1: early November, t2: 11 days, t3: two days, t4: 2011, t5: 2011, e0: storm, e1: produced, e2: formed, e3: moved up, e4: broke, e5: resulting in, e6: storm, e7: arrived, e8: Hurricane, e9: caused, e10: outages, e11: damage, e12: causing, e13: damage, e14: dumped, e15: increased, e16: uprooted, e17: collapsed, e18: caused, e19: damage, e20: storm, e21: costs, e22: outages, e23: storm, e24: impacting, e25: get, e26: outages, e27: chose, e28: postpone, e29: cancel, e30: Delays, e31: restoring, e32: led to, e33: resignation, e34: operating\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

They formed part of the foreshock sequence for the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, the largest recorded earthquake in history. The first was on May 21 at 06:02 UTC-4. Its epicenter was near Cañete, Bío Bío Region, Chile, and its magnitude was 8.1  or 8.3M and 7.3 or 7.5M. This earthquake, which lasted 35 seconds, destroyed a third of the buildings in the city of Concepción. The earthquake effectively interrupted and ended Lota's coal miners march on Concepción where they demanded higher salaries. The second happened on May 22 at 06:30 UTC-4. Its epicenter was in the Nahuelbuta National Park, Araucanía Region, Chile, and its magnitude was 7.1 M. It was followed by a 6.8 M earthquake at 06:32 UTC-4.

The two trains derailed each other, and four cars fell off the viaduct. 40 people were killed, at least 192 were injured, 12 of which were severe injuries. This serious traffic disaster was caused by both the critical defects of design and the rough management of the bullet train company. Officials responded to the accident by hastily concluding rescue operations and ordering the burial of the derailed cars. These actions elicited strong criticism from Chinese media and online communities. In response, the government issued directives to restrict media coverage, which was met with limited compliance, even on state-owned networks. The collision is the only fatal crash involving high-speed rail (HSR) in China, and is the third-deadliest HSR accident in history, after the 1998 Eschede train disaster in Germany and 2013 Santiago de Compostela rail disaster in Spain. High speed was not a factor in the accident, however, since neither train was moving faster than , a moderate speed for a passenger train. The accident, the first of its kind, had a profound impact on the development of high-speed rail in China. Public confidence in high-speed rail eroded, resulting in fewer passengers using the service. Construction of high-speed rail lines in China was temporarily suspended as the accident was under investigation. Speeds on other major high-speed rail lines in China were reduced. China's reputation in high-speed railway technology was scrutinized internationally. In response to the accident, Railways minister Sheng Guangzu announced a comprehensive two-month railway safety review. The official investigation completed in December 2011 blamed faulty signal systems which failed to warn the second train of the stationary first train on the same track, as well as a series of management failures on the part of railway officials in carrying out due procedure. The accident and subsequent safety improvements helped implement further safety measures helping prevent any further safety accidents in China's high speed rail network. During the years 2012 to 2019, China's high speed rail network did not have any serious accidents.\nevents: t0: 23 July 2011, t1: 1998, t2: December 2011, t3: 2012, t4: 2019, t5: 2013, e0: travelling, e1: derailed, e2: fell, e3: killed, e4: injured, e5: caused, e6: responded, e7: rescue, e8: ordering, e9: derailed, e10: elicited, e11: response, e12: issued, e13: restrict, e14: met with, e15: involving, e16: moving, e17: impact, e18: using, e19: suspended, e20: investigation, e21: reduced, e22: scrutinized, e23: response, e24: announced, e25: completed, e26: blamed, e27: carrying out, e28: helped, e29: helping, e30: accidents\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Tour or simply The Fuck Tour) was a North American concert tour by hard rock band Van Halen in support of their album "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge". It was one of the band\'s longer tours, divided into 99 dates. It featured shows in Hawaii and Mexico, places Van Halen rarely played in their history. At the two Fresno, California, shows, the band filmed and recorded material for the live double album \' and live VHS \' (later also released on DVD). Promotion for these live works was the foundation of the band\'s next tour. This tour included the song "Jump" in the set list. This song from 1984 had been the band\'s only US Hot 100 number 1, but in his attempt to \'forget\' the band\'s past, Sammy Hagar had refused to sing it at every show when he joined the band in 1985. Now an established member of the line-up, he agreed to sing it more often. This tour also marked the first time that keyboards were not performed live on stage by Eddie Van Halen. Keyboard and piano parts were prerecorded by Eddie and played back during the concerts. The tour was managed by touring veteran Scotty Ross, who has also managed the tours of Poison, Dio, Saliva and Celtic Woman.\nevents: t0: 1984, t1: 1985, e0: concert, e1: support, e2: played, e3: recorded, e4: released, e5: tour, e6: refused, e7: sing, e8: joined, e9: established, e10: agreed, e11: marked, e12: performed, e13: played, e14: managed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It was the first event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card, three of which involved championships. The main event was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the challenger Christian Cage. Angle ended up winning the bout, thus retaining the championship. A.J. Styles and Tomko defended the TNA World Tag Team Championship against the team of Kevin Nash and Samoa Joe on the card. Styles and Tomko retained the tag team championship in the encounter. The team of Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) fought the team of Jay Lethal and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) in a Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match. Devine and Team 3D were the victors in the contest. The TNA Women's Knockout Championship defense by Gail Kim against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match was another highly promoted match for the event. Kim won the bout, successfully retaining the title.

The Hussites were led by Břeněk of Švihov - who was killed in battle - and Jan Žižka, whose forces proved victorious. This was the second major battle of the Hussite Wars; the first battle, the Battle of Nekmíř, was more of a Hussite retreat than a true fight. The Battle of Sudoměř began after Hussite forces which had taken up temporary fortifications on the plains were found by Royalist forces, who closed in for an attack. The Hussites were greatly outnumbered 5 to 1, and initially hoisted the white flag, but when the Royalists refused to accept their surrender the battle truly began. Though outnumbered and comparatively ill-equipped, facing heavily armoured knights, the Hussites had fortified their surroundings ingeniously. Their flank was protected by war wagons loaded with arquebusiers, and many large ponds and marshy areas surrounded the Hussite infantry - ground which the Royalist Cavalry could not hope to cross. One thousand Knights Hospitaller from Strakonice led by Jindřich of Hradec - killed in battle - attacked war wagons placed on a slim dam, with huge casualties but no success. After that, another thousand Royalist cavalrymen, led by Peter von Konopischt of Sternberg - killed in the Battle of Vítkov Hill later that year - rushed a weakly held side of the Hussite formation, but were mired in marshy ground. They dismounted in order to progress, but soon found themselves mired once more. Following this, the Hussite light infantry equipped with flails were able to easily finish the cavalrymen. The battle ended with the advance of night and fog, during which Žižka and the Hussite forces were able to escape. Though the Catholic Royalists were not entirely defeated, the fact the Hussites were able to inflict such heavy casualties with so few men, and then escape soundly proved to be a great victory. Only 400 hussites - farmers and townsmen, including women and children - beat the 2,000-strong force of heavily armoured cavalry. Hussite General, Jan Žižka, through superior knowledge of tactics and terrain, along with the highly effective deployment of (wagon fort) strategies, won the day.\nevents: t0: 25 March 1420, t1: later that year, e0: Battle, e1: fought, e2: led, e3: killed, e4: battle, e5: battle, e6: Wars, e7: battle, e8: Battle, e9: retreat, e10: Battle, e11: began, e12: taken up, e13: found, e14: closed, e15: attack, e16: hoisted, e17: refused, e18: surrender, e19: battle, e20: began, e21: ill-equipped, e22: facing, e23: fortified, e24: protected, e25: surrounded, e26: cross, e27: led, e28: killed, e29: battle, e30: attacked, e31: placed, e32: casualties, e33: led, e34: killed, e35: Battle, e36: rushed, e37: held, e38: mired, e39: dismounted, e40: found, e41: equipped, e42: finish, e43: battle, e44: ended, e45: escape, e46: defeated, e47: casualties, e48: escape, e49: beat, e50: deployment\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Rammasun had destructive impacts across the Philippines, South China, and Vietnam in July 2014. Rammasun is a Siamese word for thunder god. After Lingling and Kajiki earlier in 2014, Rammasun became the third tropical cyclone, and first typhoon to directly impact the Philippines in 2014. The ninth named storm and the third typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Rammasun formed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, an area near the equator where the northeast and southeast trade winds come together, and slowly drifted northwest. Having passed through the islands of Micronesia, the system turned west and quickly moved under the influence of a subtropical ridge (STR). Rammasun posed a significant threat to the Philippine island of Luzon, as it was expected to reach typhoon intensity before making landfall there. Though initially forecast to make landfall in Cagayan Valley, the storm followed a more westerly path and was later forecast to make landfall in the Bicol Region and then pass through Bataan and Zambales before brushing past Metro Manila. In preparation for the storm, Governor of Guam Eddie Calvo declared the island in Condition of Readiness 3 and later upgraded it to Condition of Readiness 1. On July 11, NASA satellites revealed Rammasun passing directly over Guam. The American National Weather Service stated that an unexpected rise in wind shear kept the system from intensifying much further before reaching Guam. Rammasun only made landfall on Guam as a tropical depression, with winds much weaker than earlier anticipated. However, under the system, the island received a substantial amount of rainfall, making that day the wettest in around 3 months. The United States territory received 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 inches) of rain. Along with the Philippines, Taiwan also expected impact from Rammasun. Moderate to heavy rainfall was predicted through most of the country. Chinese meteorologists were focusing on second and/or third landfalls in the Chinese Hainan province and northern Vietnam. Residents of Hong Kong were also warned of rainfall and subsequent landslides. Following the closure of maritime seaports, more than 100 passengers were reportedly stranded at the Port of Batangas, along with 39 rolling cargoes. Meanwhile, at least 841 passengers were stranded in five ports in the Bicol region, namely Matnog, Tabaco, Bulan, Cataingan and Pilar. A total 50 flights were cancelled and over 100 thousand families were evacuated as the typhoon neared landfall. The Philippine Department of Health said that they have prepared all government hospitals to aid the rescue and relief process during and after the typhoon. They claimed that they are much better prepared now, than they were for earlier typhoons. Ahead of the landfall, a city in the province of Albay had declared a state of calamity. At around 17:00 Philippine Standard Time (09:00 UTC), Rammasun\'s eye passed directly over Rapu-Rapu, Albay while the storm was at its initial peak intensity. Various parts of the National Capital Region reported power outages during the storm. They were reportedly caused by "a temporary system balance at 1:29 a.m. due to a sudden plant outage." At least 6,000 people were stranded at various seaports throughout the country due to the storm. Throughout its devastating journey through southern Luzon, the powerful typhoon barely weakened but instead maintained its strength and even intensified as it made its way across the Bicol Region.\nevents: t0: 1954, t1: July 2014, t2: 2014, t3: 2014, t4: July 11, t5: 3 months, t6: 1:29 a.m., t7: 17:00, t8: 09:00 utc, e0: known, e1: impacts, e2: became, e3: impact, e4: formed, e5: come together, e6: drifted, e7: passed, e8: turned, e9: moved, e10: threat, e11: reach, e12: landfall, e13: landfall, e14: storm, e15: followed, e16: landfall, e17: pass, e18: declared, e19: upgraded, e20: revealed, e21: passing, e22: stated, e23: kept, e24: landfall, e25: received, e26: received, e27: impact, e28: predicted, e29: focusing, e30: warned, e31: stranded, e32: stranded, e33: cancelled, e34: evacuated, e35: neared, e36: said, e37: prepared, e38: claimed, e39: prepared, e40: landfall, e41: declared, e42: passed, e43: reported, e44: caused, e45: stranded, e46: weakened, e47: maintained, e48: intensified\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The raid was carried out by a small unit of Royal Marines known as the Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment (RMBPD), part of Combined Operations inserted by HMS Tuna (N94) captained by Lieutenant-Commander Dick Raikes who, earlier, had been awarded the DSO for operations while in command of the submarine HMS Seawolf. (The RMBPD would later form the Special Boat Service). The plan was for six kayaks (called "canoes" by the British) to be taken to the area of the Gironde estuary by submarine. The twelve men would then paddle by night to Bordeaux. On arrival they would attack the docked cargo ships with limpet mines and then escape overland to Spain. Twelve men from no.1 section were selected for the raid; including the commanding officer, Herbert \'Blondie\' Hasler, and with the reserve Marine Colley the total of the team numbered thirteen. One canoe was damaged while being deployed from the submarine and it and its crew therefore could not take part in the mission. Only two of the 10 men who launched from the submarine survived the raid: Hasler, and his no.2 in the canoe, Bill Sparks. Of the other eight, six were executed by the Germans while two died from hypothermia.\nevents: t0: the Second World War, e0: raid, e1: carried out, e2: awarded, e3: command, e4: form, e5: paddle, e6: arrival, e7: attack, e8: escape, e9: selected, e10: damaged, e11: deployed, e12: launched, e13: raid, e14: died\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The eleventh named storm and sixth cyclone of the season, Kalunde formed on March 4 from an area of disturbed weather east-southeast of Diego Garcia. The storm steadily strengthened and attained severe tropical storm intensity on March 6. After starting a phase of rapid deepening, Kalunde attained cyclone intensity the next day. Kalunde attained its peak intensity on March 8, as an intense tropical cyclone. It maintained its peak strength for a day; shortly thereafter, the system began to weaken. After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, the storm brushed Rodrigues. Shortly after doing so, Kalunde weakened into a tropical cyclone and later a severe tropical storm. Two days later, on March 16, the cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day. Cyclone Kalunde brought US$3.15 million in damage to Rodrigues Island. A total of 1,600 homes and 40 boats were damaged. Severe coastal damage took place across the island; many roads were washed out. Power outages also occurred across the island, delaying residents access to information pertaining to Kalunde. About 80 percent of the drinking water was contaminated and the entire food crop was destroyed.

The "Glorioso", carrying four million silver dollars from the Americas, was able to repel two British attacks off the Azores and Cape Finisterre, successfully landing her cargo at the port of Corcubión, Spain. Several days after unloading the cargo, while sailing to Cadiz for repairs, "Glorioso" was attacked successively near Cape St Vincent by four British privateer frigates and the ships of the line HMS "Dartmouth" and HMS "Russell" from Admiral John Byng\'s fleet. The "Dartmouth" blew up killing most of her crew, but the 92-gun "Russell" eventually forced the "Glorioso" to strike the colours. The British took her to Lisbon, where she had to be broken up because of the extensive damage suffered during the last battle. The commander of the ship, Pedro Messia de la Cerda, and his men, were taken to Great Britain as prisoners, but were considered heroes in Spain and gained the admiration of their enemies.

The attack took place near the Kissufim Crossing near their home in Gush Katif bloc of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada. After shooting at the vehicle in which Hatuel was driving with her daughters, witnesses said the militants approached the vehicle and shot the occupants repeatedly at close range. An alliance of Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was carried out in reprisal for the assassinations of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Abdelaziz Rantisi by the Israeli army some weeks earlier. The attack shocked the Israeli public, and was classified by Amnesty International as a crime against humanity. On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a Palestinian member of Islamic Jihad from the Khan Yunis area, who according to Shin Bet officials admitted to several acts of violence, including the attack on Hatuel and her daughters.\nevents: t0: May 2 , 2004, t1: some weeks earlier, t2: June 6 , 2007, t3: eight months, e0: shooting, e1: killed, e2: took place, e3: shooting, e4: driving, e5: said, e6: approached, e7: shot, e8: resistance, e9: claimed, e10: attack, e11: stating, e12: carried out, e13: shocked, e14: classified, e15: arrested\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

In the context of the 2012–13 North American drought (especially the 2011–17 California drought), as well as powerful Santa Ana winds, weather conditions were ideal for wildfires. A total of 7,865 wildfires ignited throughout the year, which burned at least of land. The wildfires caused a total of 146 injuries and 2 fatalities, in addition to causing at least $204.05 million (2014 USD) in damage. The season began unusually early when a wildfire ignited on January 1, followed by 6 more fires igniting later within the same month. During a heat wave and dry Santa Ana conditions in May 2014, multiple wildfires broke out simultaneously in San Diego County, along with several other wildfires elsewhere in California. By mid-May, fire officials said they had already dealt with 1,400 wildfires in California in 2014 - twice the normal amount for that time of year - and a spokesman for CAL FIRE described the conditions as "unprecedented." The May 2014 San Diego County wildfires were estimated to have caused at least $60 million (2014 USD) in damage. In late June to early August, another group of wildfires ignited across the state, some of which reached over twenty thousand acres in size. In mid-September, the largest group of wildfires erupted, with some wildfires becoming larger than 50,000 acres in size. In early September 2014, the Happy Complex Fire became the largest wildfire of the season, eventually topping out at in size on September 27. On October 8, an aerial tanker crashed during a firefighting effort at the Dog Rock Fire, which killed the pilot and sparked a small wildfire. From late September to late October, the latest flare-up of major wildfires were extinguished by cooler weather and precipitation. From December 10–13, a powerful winter storm extinguished the remaining wildfires that were present. In mid-December through late December, several more small wildfires sparked, but they were all extinguished by December 31. In 2014, a study found a human fingerprint in growing California wildfire risks. The paper is titled “Extreme fire season in California: A glimpse into the future?” It was published as the second chapter of “Explaining Extreme Events of 2014”, by the American Meteorological Society. The authors also projected into the future, and the predicted results showed increases in the drought index, the area under extreme threat of fires, and the days of fire danger, stating that, "The increase in extreme fire risk is expected within the coming decade to exceed that of natural variability and this serves as an indication that anthropogenic climate warming will likely play a significant role in influence California’s fire season."\nevents: t0: 2014, t1: September, t2: 2012–13, t3: 2011–17, t4: January 1, t5: May 2014, t6: 2014, t7: late June, t8: early August, t9: mid-September, t10: early September 2014, t11: September 27, t12: October 8, t13: late September, t14: late October, t15: December 10–13, t16: mid-December, t17: late December, t18: 2014, t19: 2014, t20: May, t21: mid-May, t22: May 2014, t23: December 31, t24: the same month, e0: wildfires, e1: igniting, e2: fires, e3: wildfires, e4: burning, e5: drought, e6: drought, e7: wildfires, e8: ignited, e9: burned, e10: wildfires, e11: caused, e12: injuries, e13: fatalities, e14: causing, e15: damage, e16: began, e17: wildfire, e18: ignited, e19: fires, e20: igniting, e21: wildfires, e22: broke out, e23: wildfires, e24: said, e25: dealt, e26: wildfires, e27: described, e28: wildfires, e29: estimated, e30: caused, e31: damage, e32: wildfires, e33: ignited, e34: reached, e35: wildfires, e36: erupted, e37: wildfires, e38: becoming, e39: Fire, e40: became, e41: wildfire, e42: crashed, e43: Fire, e44: killed, e45: sparked, e46: wildfire, e47: wildfires, e48: extinguished, e49: extinguished, e50: wildfires, e51: present, e52: wildfires, e53: sparked, e54: extinguished, e55: found, e56: titled, e57: published, e58: projected, e59: showed, e60: increases, e61: fires, e62: stating, e63: increase, e64: exceed, e65: warming, e66: influence\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The Jam, which began in 1993, typically took place the fourth weekend in September. From 1993 to 2009, this was a three-day beginning Friday and ending Sunday. The 2011 revival was a two-day event on Friday and Saturday only. It featured acts from all genres of music including local bands, emerging talent, old favorites, and the top artists of the day. Along with the music, the Big Spring Jam also held an annual 5k race. The title of the festival is a matter of confusion for many, especially those outside Huntsville, as the Big "Spring" Jam was held early each autumn. The title, however, came from the location, Big Spring International Park in downtown Huntsville. Big Spring Jam usually featured four or more temporary stages set up throughout the park. Each stage typically featured the same genres of music throughout the weekend. One stage featured country music exclusively, another featured Christian contemporary, and the remainder of the stages were rock-based. To alleviate the impact of inclement weather, in 2011 the country music stage was moved indoors to the Propst Arena in the Von Braun Center. Unlike most other large-scale music festivals, Big Spring Jam was a not-for-profit event, organized each year by the Huntsville Heritage Foundation in conjunction with the Von Braun Center. Proceeds from the event benefited local charities, health and human services agencies, and arts and entertainment organizations throughout North Alabama. In recent years, the Big Spring Jam suffered a tarnished reputation due to weather events. In both 2005, and 2006, some of the main acts were canceled due to inclement weather. Despite existing as a non-profit event, Big Spring Jam officials refused to refund ticket prices after canceling events. For example, tickets were sold after the event was rained out in 2006 - and officials refused to refund the ticket prices. Tickets were sold up until the point the event was canceled. However, the 2007 and 2008 events, where the weather was favorable, were deemed highly successful. The 2010 event was cancelled due to financial and logistical issues but the event returned, as promised, in 2011. The 2011 Big Spring Jam was a smaller, two-day event with some acts moved into the Propst Arena at the Von Braun Center. The 2011 event drew only 30,000 attendees, down sharply from the 240,000 who attended in 2003, with blame placed on the smaller scope of the event, competition from high school and college football, the economic downturn, and weather on the Jam\'s first day. Organizers announced in November 2011 that they would "shelve" the event for the immediate future with plans to "retool" or "recreate" it at some point when the economy improves and local interest increases.\nevents: t0: 1993, t1: 1993, t2: 2009, t3: Friday, t4: Sunday, t5: 2011, t6: Friday, t7: Saturday, t8: 2011, t9: 2005, t10: 2006, t11: 2006, t12: 2007, t13: 2008, t14: 2010, t15: 2011, t16: 2011, t17: 2011, t18: 2003, t19: two-day, t20: November 2011, t21: the fourth weekend, t22: September, t23: three-day, t24: two-day, t25: recent years, e0: festival, e1: taking place, e2: began, e3: took place, e4: beginning, e5: ending, e6: revival, e7: acts, e8: held, e9: held, e10: set up, e11: featured, e12: featured, e13: alleviate, e14: moved, e15: organized, e16: suffered, e17: tarnished, e18: acts, e19: canceled, e20: existing, e21: refused, e22: refund, e23: sold, e24: rained, e25: refused, e26: refund, e27: sold, e28: canceled, e29: deemed, e30: cancelled, e31: returned, e32: acts, e33: moved, e34: drew, e35: attended, e36: blame, e37: placed, e38: competition, e39: announced, e40: retool, e41: recreate, e42: improves, e43: increases\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The pilots of two United States Air Force (USAF) F-15 fighter aircraft, operating under the control of a USAF airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft, misidentified two United States Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters as Iraqi Mil Mi-24 "Hind" helicopters. The F-15 pilots fired on and destroyed both helicopters, killing all 26 military and civilians aboard, including personnel from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Turkey, and the Kurdish community. A subsequent USAF investigation blamed the accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, the crew members of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the identification friend or foe (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by court-martial, in which he was acquitted. As a result of complaints by family members of the victims and others that the military was failing to hold its personnel accountable, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House conducted their own investigations into the shootdown and the U.S. military\'s response to it. Also, Ronald R. Fogleman, the USAF\'s new Chief of Staff, conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident. Fogleman\'s investigation led to several of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers to be interviewed for the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but also noted that the DoD had refused access to key witnesses.\nevents: t0: 14 april 1994, t1: 1994, e0: incident, e1: occurred, e2: misidentified, e3: fired, e4: destroyed, e5: killing, e6: blamed, e7: faulted, e8: blamed, e9: functioned, e10: failed, e11: integrate, e12: received, e13: failing, e14: hold, e15: conducted, e16: investigations, e17: response, e18: conducted, e19: led to, e20: receiving, e21: refused, e22: interviewed, e23: found, e24: operated, e25: designed, e26: noted, e27: refused\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The war was preceded by protests in Zawiya on 8 August 2009 and finally ignited by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd. The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country, with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body, the National Transitional Council. The United Nations Security Council passed an initial resolution on 26 February, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and his inner circle and restricting their travel, and referred the matter to the International Criminal Court for investigation. In early March, Gaddafi\'s forces rallied, pushed eastwards and re-took several coastal cities before reaching Benghazi. A further UN resolution authorised member states to establish and enforce a no-fly zone over Libya, and to use "all necessary measures" to prevent attacks on civilians, which turned into a bombing campaign by the forces of NATO against military installations and civilian infrastructure of Libya. The Gaddafi government then announced a ceasefire, but fighting and bombing continued. Throughout the conflict, rebels rejected government offers of a ceasefire and efforts by the African Union to end the fighting because the plans set forth did not include the removal of Gaddafi. In August, rebel forces launched an offensive on the government-held coast of Libya, backed by a wide-reaching NATO bombing campaign, taking back territory lost months before and ultimately capturing the capital city of Tripoli, while Gaddafi evaded capture and loyalists engaged in a rearguard campaign. On 16 September 2011, the National Transitional Council was recognised by the United Nations as the legal representative of Libya, replacing the Gaddafi government. Muammar Gaddafi evaded capture until 20 October 2011, when he was captured and killed in Sirte. The National Transitional Council "declared the liberation of Libya" and the official end of the war on 23 October 2011. In the aftermath of the civil war, a low-level insurgency by former Gaddafi loyalists continued. There have been various disagreements and strife between local militia and tribes, including fighting on 23 January 2012 in the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid, leading to an alternative town council being established and later recognized by the National Transitional Council (NTC). A much greater issue has been the role of militias which fought in the civil war and their role in the new Libya. Some have refused to disarm, and cooperation with the NTC has been strained, leading to demonstrations against militias and government action to disband such groups or integrate them into the Libyan military. These unresolved issues led directly to a second civil war in Libya.\nevents: t0: 2011, t1: 8 August 2009, t2: Tuesday , 15 February 2011, t3: 26 February, t4: early March, t5: August, t6: 16 September 2011, t7: 20 October 2011, t8: 23 October 2011, t9: 23 January 2012, e0: referred, e1: conflict, e2: preceded, e3: led to, e4: fired, e5: establishing, e6: passed, e7: freezing, e8: restricting, e9: pushed, e10: authorised, e11: establish, e12: enforce, e13: use, e14: prevent, e15: turned, e16: announced, e17: rejected, e18: end, e19: set, e20: taking, e21: evaded, e22: recognised, e23: replacing, e24: evaded, e25: captured, e26: killed, e27: declared, e28: end, e29: leading to, e30: established, e31: recognized, e32: fought, e33: refused, e34: leading to, e35: integrate, e36: led\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

This attack was the 54th Japanese airstrike over Australia.

Six Irish Catholic civilians died after members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group, broke into their homes and shot them. Three members of the Reavey family were shot at their home in Whitecross and four members of the O\'Dowd family were shot at their home in Ballydougan. Two of the Reaveys and three of the O\'Dowds were killed outright, with the third Reavey victim dying of brain hemorrhage almost a month later. The shootings were part of a string of attacks on Catholics and Irish nationalists by the "Glenanne gang"; an alliance of loyalist militants, British soldiers and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) police officers. Billy McCaughey, a police officer from the RUC Special Patrol Group, admitted taking part and accused another officer of being involved. His colleague John Weir said that those involved included a British soldier, two police officers and an alleged police agent: Robin \'the Jackal\' Jackson. The next day, gunmen shot dead ten Ulster Protestant civilians in the Kingsmill massacre. This was claimed as retaliation for the Reavey and O\'Dowd shootings.

Teams representing 25 countries participated in several levels of competition. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1992 competition. The top Championship Group A tournament took place in Finland from 19 April to 4 May 1991, with games played in Turku, Helsinki and Tampere. Eight teams took part, with each team playing each other once. The four best teams then played each other once more. Sweden became world champions for the fifth time, and the Soviet Union won their 27th European title. In the European Championships, only matches between European teams in the first round were counted towards scoring. There were three significant 'lasts' in this year's championships. This would be the last year that a separate European title would be awarded, which the Soviets captured in their last appearance before the dissolution of the Soviet Union seven months later. Their position in Group A would be inherited by Russia, while newly independent former Soviet member states Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine began play in 1993 in qualification tournaments for Group C. The tournament itself would change significantly after this year as well. This was the last time the top level was contested by eight teams; beginning in 1992 it would expand to twelve, requiring both Groups B and C to promote four nations each. The final round of four teams was a very tight battle, except for the United States. Getting only a tie against the last place Germans, the Americans only advanced to the final round by narrowly defeating the host Finns. The USA were easily defeated by the three other teams in the final round, but were involved in a controversial finish. The Canadians, having tied both the Swedes and the Soviets, needed to win their game against the US by five goals, then hope that the Swedes and Soviets tied, ensuring Canada the gold. Winning 7-4 in the final minute, and despite playing short-handed, they miraculously got the two goals they needed. American coach Tim Taylor, trailing 9-4, pulled his goalie in the final minute, later claiming that he was trying to score the necessary number of goals to win the bronze medal. It was the last of many questionable finishes over the years that hastened the IIHF to change the format of the tournament. The Soviets and Swedes took a 1-1 tie into the third period of the last game, which would have given the gold medal to Canada had it held up. However, Mats Sundin scored at 9:37, and the Swedes held on to capture gold.\nevents: t0: 19 April, t1: 4 May 1991, t2: seven months later, t3: 1992, t4: 1991, t5: 1992, t6: 1993, e0: Championships, e1: sanctioned, e2: Championships, e3: participated, e4: competition, e5: competition, e6: competition, e7: tournament, e8: took place, e9: played, e10: playing, e11: played, e12: became, e13: Championships, e14: championships, e15: awarded, e16: captured, e17: inherited, e18: began, e19: tournaments, e20: tournament, e21: change, e22: contested, e23: beginning, e24: expand, e25: promote, e26: battle, e27: advanced, e28: defeating, e29: defeated, e30: involved, e31: tied, e32: tied, e33: ensuring, e34: playing, e35: got, e36: pulled, e37: claiming, e38: score, e39: win, e40: finishes, e41: hastened, e42: change, e43: tournament, e44: given, e45: scored, e46: held on to, e47: capture\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The three-day event is the largest military air show in the United States, with total annual attendance estimated at 700,000. The show is held in October coinciding with Fleet Week activities in San Diego. The 2011 show was the 56th edition of the event, and celebrated the 100th anniversary of naval aviation. In 2007, the Miramar Air Show was voted the "World\'s Best Military Air Show" by the International Council of Air Shows, the first time the award was given to a Marine Corps air station since 1994. The show includes a large selection of "static" (non-flying) displays representing aircraft from the United States Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as civilian and historic military aircraft. Numerous commercial vendors, recruiting displays representing all of the United States armed forces, area law enforcement recruiters, civilian flight organizations and a business and franchise fair are also on site.

Starting from Emperor Wu's reign (r. 141–87 BC), the Han empire changed from a relatively passive foreign policy to an offensive strategy to deal with the increasing Xiongnu incursions on the northern frontier and also according to general imperial policy to expand the domain. In 133 BC, the conflict escalated to a full-scale war when the Xiongnu realized that the Han were about to ambush their raiders at Mayi. The Han court decided to deploy several military expeditions towards the regions situated in the Ordos Loop, Hexi Corridor and Gobi Desert in a successful attempt to conquer it and expel the Xiongnu. Hereafter, the war progressed further towards the many smaller states of the Western Regions. The nature of the battles varied through time, with many casualties during the changes of territorial possession and political control over the western states. Regional alliances also tended to shift, sometimes forcibly, when one party gained the upper hand in a certain territory over the other. Han Empire eventually prevailed over the northern nomads, and the war allowed the Han Empire's political influence expanded deeply into Central Asia. As the situation deteriorated for the Xiongnu, civil conflicts befell and further weakened the confederation, which eventually splitted into two groups. The Southern Xiongnu submitted to the Han Empire, but the Northern Xiongnu continued to resist and was eventually evicted westwards by the further expeditions from Han Empire and its vassals, and the rise of Donghu states like Xianbei. Marked by significant events involving the conquests over various smaller states for control and many large-scale battles, the war resulted in the total victory of the Han empire over the Xiongnu state in 89 AD.\nevents: t0: 133 BC, t1: 89 AD, t2: 89 AD, t3: 141–87 BC, t4: 133 BC, e0: fought, e1: Starting, e2: changed, e3: deal, e4: expand, e5: escalated, e6: war, e7: realized, e8: ambush, e9: decided, e10: deploy, e11: situated, e12: conquer, e13: expel, e14: war, e15: progressed, e16: varied, e17: shift, e18: gained, e19: prevailed, e20: war, e21: allowed, e22: influence, e23: expanded, e24: deteriorated, e25: weakened, e26: submitted, e27: resist, e28: evicted, e29: Marked, e30: control, e31: war, e32: resulted in\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The military established a junta called the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) to govern the nation. After dissolving the government and the Senate, the NCPO vested executive and legislative powers in its leader and ordered the judicial branch to operate under its directives. In addition, it partially repealed the 2007 constitution, save the second chapter which concerns the king, declared martial law and curfew nationwide, banned political gatherings, arrested and detained politicians and anti-coup activists, imposed Internet censorship and took control of the media.

According to Turkish Armed Forces, 25 servicemen died, four other soldiers and three civilians were injured by the accident. A fire at the locality followed the explosion. The remains of two noncommissioned officers, two special sergeants and 21 privates were recovered after the fire was extinguished. The explosion occurred during classification works in the depot. Ammunition was transported from a depot of the 44th Ammunition Company in Susurluk, Balıkesir to Afyonkarahisar by train, and from the train station in the city to the facility by civilian trucks. The arsenal commander ordered the completion of tally and classification works before a scheduled official inspection in ten days time. For that reason, works in the depot continued in the night although any work in the arsenal depots is not allowed in the darkness due to lack of lighting in those facilities. During the accident time, the depot's inside was being illuminated by the light beam from the headlamps of a truck parked before the depot gate, by flashlights and possibly by lighters. The reason for the explosion was thought to be that one of grenades exploded accidentally and others exploded sequentially. Military authorities said that soldiers tallied in the arsenal depot since a couple of days. The Prime Minister announced that four commanders of the facility were removed from their post and appointed to other military units. The depot no. 32, at which the explosion took place, was within the 41st Ammunition Company of the 4th Munition Division at the 500th Arsenal Command of the Turkish Army Corps of Engineers. The officers stationed at the site told during the hearing before the military prosecutor that 248 tonnes hand grenades and 360 tonnes ammunition were tried to be piled in two depots instead of in five depots as required. The investigation was carried out by a military prosecutor from the 1st Tactical Air Force Command in Eskişehir, which is in command of the facility in Afyonkarahisar. The military court ruled the detention of a major, and the trial of two other officers in the rank of a colonel and a first lieutenant without arrest. The major is accused of involuntary manslaughter. The military prosecutor stated that no evidence could be found showing that the explosion was a result of terrorism or sabotage.\nevents: t0: 21:15, t1: 5 September 2012, t2: a couple of days, t3: 2012, t4: ten days, e0: explosion, e1: died, e2: injured, e3: explosion, e4: recovered, e5: extinguished, e6: explosion, e7: transported, e8: allowed, e9: illuminated, e10: parked, e11: said, e12: announced, e13: removed, e14: appointed, e15: took place, e16: told, e17: piled, e18: carried out, e19: ruled, e20: accused, e21: stated, e22: found\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

King Louis XIV confronted the combined opposition of the princes, the nobility, the law courts ("parlements"), and most of the French people, and yet won out in the end. The dispute started when the government of France issued seven fiscal edicts, six of which were to increase taxation. The parlements pushed back and questioned the constitutionality of the King\'s actions and sought to check his powers. The Fronde was divided into two campaigns, the Parlementary Fronde and the Fronde of the Princes. The timing of the outbreak of the Parlementary Fronde, directly after the Peace of Westphalia (1648) that ended the Thirty Years\' War, was significant. The nuclei of the armed bands that terrorized parts of France under aristocratic leaders during this period had been hardened in a generation of war in Germany, where troops still tended to operate autonomously. Louis XIV, impressed as a young ruler with the experience of the Fronde, came to reorganize French fighting forces under a stricter hierarchy whose leaders ultimately could be made or unmade by the King. Cardinal Mazarin blundered into the crisis but came out well ahead at the end. The Fronde represented the final attempt of the French nobility to do battle with the king, and they were humiliated. In the long-term, the Fronde served to strengthen royal authority, but weakened the economy. The Fronde facilitated the emergence of absolute monarchy.\nevents: t0: 1635, t1: 1648, t2: 1653, t3: 1648, e0: wars, e1: occurring, e2: begun, e3: confronted, e4: opposition, e5: end, e6: dispute, e7: started, e8: increase, e9: pushed, e10: questioned, e11: check, e12: campaigns, e13: outbreak, e14: ended, e15: hardened, e16: war, e17: operate, e18: impressed, e19: reorganize, e20: fighting, e21: crisis, e22: end, e23: battle, e24: humiliated, e25: served, e26: strengthen, e27: weakened, e28: facilitated, e29: emergence\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Two senior Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers, Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, were shot dead in an ambush by the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade. Breen and Buchanan were returning from an informal cross-border security conference in Dundalk with senior Garda officers when Buchanan's car – a red Vauxhall Cavalier — was flagged down and fired upon by six IRA gunmen, who the policemen had taken for British soldiers. Buchanan was killed outright whilst Breen, suffering gunshot wounds, was deliberately shot in the back of the head after he had left the car waving a white handkerchief. They were the highest-ranking RUC officers to be killed during the Troubles. To date nobody has been charged with killing the two officers. There have been allegations that the attack was the result of collusion between the Gardaí and the Provisional IRA. Canadian judge Peter Cory investigated the killings in 2003; his findings were published in a report. This led to the Irish government setting up the Smithwick Tribunal, a judicial inquiry into the killings which opened in Dublin in June 2011 and published its final report in December 2013. In the report Judge Peter Smithwick stated that ‘on balance of probability’, somebody inside the Dundalk Garda station had passed on information to the IRA regarding the presence of Breen and Buchanan.\nevents: t0: 20 March 1989, t1: 2003, t2: December 2013, t3: June 2011, e0: ambush, e1: took place, e2: shot, e3: dead, e4: ambush, e5: returning, e6: conference, e7: flagged, e8: fired, e9: taken, e10: killed, e11: wounds, e12: shot, e13: left, e14: waving, e15: killed, e16: charged, e17: killing, e18: attack, e19: judge, e20: investigated, e21: killings, e22: published, e23: led to, e24: setting up, e25: inquiry, e26: killings, e27: opened, e28: published, e29: stated, e30: passed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

According to the official figures, 660 people were killed, 1074 people were injured and over 48,000 lost their property. Unofficial reports claim as high as 2000 deaths. The Muslim community suffered the majority of the losses. Out of the 512 deaths reported in the police complaints, 430 were Muslims. Property worth 42 million rupees was destroyed during the riots, with Muslims losing 32 million worth of property. A distinctive feature of the violence was the attack on Muslim chawls by their Dalit Hindu neighbours who had maintained peaceful relations with them until this point. The riots happened during the chief ministership of the Indian National Congress leader Hitendra Desai. The Justice Reddy Commission set up by his government blamed the Hindu nationalist organizations for the violence. Various writers trace the causes of the riots to a mix of socioeconomic and political factors (see Background below). The violence started on 18 September 1969 after Muslims attacked some Hindu sadhus and a temple, after the cows herded by the sadhus caused injury to them. The Hindus later attacked a Muslim dargah, and Muslim protesters also attacked the temple again, leading to a mass breakout of violence. The riots started in Ahmedabad, and then spread to other areas, notably Vadodara, Mehsana, Nadiad, Anand and Gondal. By 26 September, the violence had been brought under control, however some more violent incidents happened during 18–28 October 1969.\nevents: t0: September–October 1969, t1: 18 September 1969, t2: 26 September, t3: 18–28 October 1969, t4: 1989, t5: 1947, e0: violence, e1: massacre, e2: arson, e3: looting, e4: violence, e5: violence, e6: killed, e7: injured, e8: lost, e9: claim, e10: deaths, e11: suffered, e12: losses, e13: deaths, e14: destroyed, e15: violence, e16: attack, e17: riots, e18: blamed, e19: violence, e20: causes, e21: violence, e22: attacked, e23: caused, e24: attacked, e25: attacked, e26: spread, e27: violence\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Three days later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released images of two suspects, who were later identified as Chechen Kyrgyzstani-American brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. They killed an MIT policeman, kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby Watertown, during which two officers were severely injured, one of whom died a year later. Tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after. An unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed. Around 6:00p.m., a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard. He was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody. During questioning, Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead. He said they learned to build explosive devices from an online magazine of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. He also said they had intended to travel to New York City to bomb Times Square. On April 8, 2015, he was convicted of 30 charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death.

Arsenal won 2–1 in normal time, in what was the first of three Wembley finals between the two sides that season; Arsenal and Wednesday also met in the FA Cup Final of that year (which went to a replay), the only time this has ever happened in English football. The match was the first match in which any European clubs had used squad numbers and player names on their shirts. On this occasion, as in the FA Cup final and replay that year, players wore individual numbers which were retained for the FA Cup finals. Coincidentally, the very first occurrence of players wearing numbered shirts came on 25 August 1928, when Arsenal and Chelsea wore numbered shirts in their matches against The Wednesday (renamed Sheffield Wednesday soon after) and Swansea Town, respectively. Squad numbers became compulsory for Premier League clubs from August 1993. In the game, Wednesday's John Harkes scored the opener in the 8th minute, before Paul Merson equalised for Arsenal. Merson then set up Steve Morrow for the winner. In the celebrations after the match, Arsenal skipper Tony Adams attempted to pick up Morrow and parade him on his shoulders, but Adams slipped and Morrow awkwardly hit the ground. He broke his arm and had to be rushed to hospital. Unable to receive his winner's medal on the day, he was eventually presented with it before the start of the FA Cup Final the following month.\nevents: t0: 18 April 1993, t1: 25 August 1928, t2: August 1993, t3: the 8th minute, t4: 1993, t5: the day, e0: Final, e1: took place, e2: played, e3: finals, e4: met, e5: Final, e6: replay, e7: happened, e8: match, e9: match, e10: used, e11: final, e12: replay, e13: wore, e14: retained, e15: finals, e16: wearing, e17: came, e18: matches, e19: renamed, e20: became, e21: game, e22: scored, e23: celebrations, e24: match, e25: pick up, e26: parade, e27: slipped, e28: hit, e29: broke, e30: rushed, e31: receive, e32: presented, e33: start, e34: Final\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The resistance broke out during the Caucasus Campaign, in which the Dashnak militias were supported by the Imperial Russian army to oppose the Ottomans. Such measures had not been intended or planned by the Armenians. Several contemporaneous observers and later historians have concluded that the Ottoman government deliberately instigated the armed Armenian resistance by enforcing the conditions on their subjects and then used this insurgency as a main pretext to justify the forced deportations of Armenians from all over the empire. However, the decisions of deportation and extermination were made before the Van resistance.

The failure occurred over Batam Island, Indonesia, four minutes after takeoff from Singapore Changi Airport. After holding for almost two hours to assess the situation, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Changi. There were no injuries to the passengers, crew or people on the ground, despite debris from the aircraft falling onto houses in Batam. On inspection, it was found that a turbine disc in the aircraft's No. 2 engine (on the port side nearest the fuselage) had disintegrated, causing extensive damage to the nacelle, wing, fuel system, landing gear, flight controls, engine controls, and a fire in a fuel tank that self-extinguished. The subsequent investigation concluded that the failure had been caused by the breaking of a stub oil pipe which had been manufactured improperly. The failure was the first of its kind for the A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. At the time of the accident, 39 A380s were operating with five airlines: Qantas, Air France, Emirates, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. The accident led to the temporary grounding of the rest of the six-plane Qantas A380 fleet. It also led to groundings, inspections and engine replacements on some other Rolls-Royce powered A380s in service with Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, but not in the A380 fleets of Air France or Emirates, which were powered by Engine Alliance engines.\nevents: t0: 4 November 2010, e0: suffered, e1: failure, e2: occurred, e3: takeoff, e4: assess, e5: injuries, e6: falling, e7: found, e8: disintegrated, e9: causing, e10: damage, e11: landing, e12: concluded, e13: caused, e14: breaking, e15: manufactured, e16: operating, e17: led to, e18: led to, e19: powered, e20: powered\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The hostages were subsequently moved to Geselama. The International Committee of the Red Cross acted as an intermediary between the OPM and the Indonesian authorities. Fifteen hostages, all of Indonesian nationality, were released relatively quickly, but eleven (comprising four Britons, two Dutch, and five Indonesians) remained in OPM hands. After lengthy negotiations the ICRC secured an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages on 8 May. However, the OPM leader, Kelly Kwalik, backed out of the agreement on the day of the intended release. The ICRC removed itself from the negotiations and stated that the Indonesian Army was no longer bound by an agreement not to engage in combat with the hostage takers. On 9 May Indonesian Army Special Forces (Kopassus) moved into the village but found it unoccupied. Five personnel were killed in a helicopter crash. A small observation force was left behind and, after this confirmed the OPM and their hostages had returned to the site on 15 May, a second assault was made. This was successful and effected the release of nine of the hostages, two being killed by their captors. Eight OPM fighters were killed and two captured versus no loss on the Indonesian side, save for the helicopter crash.

According to the historian Josephus, the forces of Ananus ben Ananus, one of the heads of the Judean provisional government and former High Priest of Israel, besieged the Zealots who held the Temple. When John of Giscala led the Zealots to believe that Ananus had contacted the Roman General Vespasian for assistance in retaking control of all Jerusalem, the Zealots, driven to desperation, asked the Edomites (Idumeans) for assistance in preventing the delivery of the city to the Romans. When the Edomites arrived, the Zealots opened the gates of Jerusalem to them, and the Edomites slaughtered ben Hanan's (Ananus ben Ananus) forces, killing him as well. After freeing the Zealots from the Temple, the Edomites and Zealots massacred the common people.

The village lies along the Albert–Bapaume road. The village is situated south of Arras, at the junction of the D 11 and the D 929 roads. Courcelette lies to the south, Pys and Miraumont to the north-west, Eaucourt l'Abbaye to the south-east, the Butte de Warlencourt is to the north-east and Destremont Farm is south-west. Military operations began in the area in September 1914 during the Race to the Sea, when the divisions of the II Bavarian Corps advanced westwards on the north bank of the Somme, passing through Le Sars towards Albert and Amiens. The village became a backwater until 1916, when the British and French began the Battle of the Somme and was the site of several air operations by the Royal Flying Corps, which attacked German supply dumps in the vicinity. During the Battle of Flers–Courcelette the British Fourth Army advanced close to the village and operations to capture it began on 1 October. The village was overrun by the 23rd Division on 7 October, during the Battle of Le Transloy several hundred prisoners being taken from the 4th Division. After the village was captured, the crest of the rise to the east became the limit of the British advance. In the winter of 1916–1917, which was the worst for fifty years, the area was considered by the troops of the I Anzac Corps to be the foulest sector of the Somme front. The village was lost in March 1918 and recaptured for the last time in August by the 21st Division.\nevents: t0: September 1914, t1: 1 October, t2: 7 October, t3: fifty years, t4: August, t5: March 1918, t6: 1916, t7: the winter of 1916–1917, e0: began, e1: advanced, e2: Battle, e3: attacked, e4: advanced, e5: capture, e6: began, e7: overrun, e8: captured, e9: rise, e10: became, e11: lost, e12: recaptured\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The conflicts were triggered by the constant Dacian threat on the Danubian province of Moesia and also by the increasing need for resources of the economy of the Empire. Trajan turned his attention to Dacia, an area north of Macedon and Greece and east of the Danube that had been on the Roman agenda since before the days of Caesar when the Dacians defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Histria. In AD 85, the Dacians swarmed over the Danube and pillaged Moesia and initially defeated the army that Emperor Domitian sent against them. The Romans were defeated in the Battle of Tapae in 88 and a truce was established. Emperor Trajan recommenced hostilities against Dacia and, following an uncertain number of battles, defeated the Dacian king Decebalus in the Second Battle of Tapae in 101. With Trajan's troops pressing towards the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa Regia, Decebalus once more sought terms. Decebalus rebuilt his power over the following years and attacked Roman garrisons again in 105. In response Trajan again marched into Dacia, besieging the Dacian capital in the Siege of Sarmizegetusa, and razing it. With Dacia quelled, Trajan subsequently invaded the Parthian empire to the east, his conquests expanding the Roman Empire to its greatest extent. Rome's borders in the east were indirectly governed through a system of client states for some time, leading to less direct campaigning than in the west in this period.\nevents: t0: 101–102, t1: 105–106, t2: AD 85, t3: 88, t4: 101, t5: 105, t6: the following years, e0: fought, e1: triggered, e2: turned, e3: defeated, e4: swarmed, e5: pillaged, e6: defeated, e7: sent, e8: defeated, e9: established, e10: recommenced, e11: defeated, e12: pressing, e13: rebuilt, e14: attacked, e15: marched, e16: besieging, e17: razing, e18: invaded, e19: expanding, e20: governed, e21: leading to\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

According to the Surinamese government, 20 women were raped, one of which was pregnant and lost her baby in the trauma. At least 24 people were injured during the riots. The injured were transported to a military hospital, while the Brazilians living in Albina were transferred to Paramaribo. Brazilians and Chinese living in the region have been evacuated. According to eyewitnesses, 17 people are missing. The Brazilian government sent a diplomatic mission on December 27, 2009 to attend the Brazilian victims. Five Brazilians returned to Brazil on December 27 on an airplane of the Brazilian Air Force. On December 28, an airplane with capacity for 40 people was sent to the city with the purpose of rescuing more Brazilians. The Surinamese government sent in troops to conduct searches and keep the peace, although violence is over by all accounts.

Neither force was aware of the presence of the other prior to the encounter and were participating in separate campaigns. The British squadron consisted of seven ships of the line accompanied by associated frigates, led by Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, were tasked with hunting down and destroying the French squadron of Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, which had departed Brest for raiding operations in the South Atlantic in December 1805, at the start of the Atlantic campaign of 1806. The French force consisted of one ship of the line and one frigate, all that remained of Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois\' squadron that had sailed for the Indian Ocean in March 1803 during the Peace of Amiens. Linois raided British shipping lanes and harbours across the region, achieving limited success against undefended merchant ships but repeatedly withdrawing in the face of determined opposition, most notably at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804. With his stores almost exhausted and the French ports east of the Cape of Good Hope that could have offered him replenishment eliminated, Linois decided to return to France in January 1806, and by March was inadvertently sailing across the cruising ground of Warren\'s squadron. Linois had twice failed to capture, or even seriously engage, large and valuable British merchant convoys on his cruise. When he saw scattered sails in the distance at 03:00 on 13 March 1806, he decided to investigate in his ship of the line "Marengo", in the hope that the ships would again prove to be a merchant convoy. By the time he realised that the approaching ships were actually a powerful naval squadron, he was too close to outrun the lead ship, Warren\'s flagship HMS "London". As "London" engaged "Marengo", the French frigate "Belle Poule" attempted to escape from the approaching squadron independently, but was also run down and brought to battle by the British frigate HMS "Amazon". Both engagements lasted over three hours and were bloody, the French ships surrendering after three and a half hours and losing nearly 70 men between them. The battle marked the end of Linois\'s three-year campaign against British trade and was the second British victory of the Atlantic campaign, following the Battle of San Domingo the previous month. Willaumez eventually returned to France, although without many of his squadron who were destroyed by British operations or Atlantic gales. Linois, despite the criticism levelled at him for his failures in the Indian Ocean, was considered to have fought hard and been unlucky to have encountered such an overwhelming force. Made a prisoner of war, Linois was not exchanged by Napoleon, who criticised his behaviour during the campaign and refused to employ him at sea again.\nevents: t0: 13 March 1806, t1: December 1805, t2: 1806, t3: March 1803, t4: February 1804, t5: january 1806, t6: 13 March 1806, t7: 03:00, e0: engagement, e1: Wars, e2: fought, e3: met, e4: aware, e5: encounter, e6: participating, e7: campaigns, e8: led, e9: tasked, e10: hunting, e11: destroying, e12: departed, e13: raiding, e14: campaign, e15: sailed, e16: raided, e17: achieving, e18: withdrawing, e19: Battle, e20: exhausted, e21: offered, e22: eliminated, e23: decided, e24: return, e25: sailing, e26: failed, e27: capture, e28: engage, e29: decided, e30: investigate, e31: prove, e32: realised, e33: outrun, e34: engaged, e35: escape, e36: run, e37: battle, e38: engagements, e39: lasted, e40: surrendering, e41: losing, e42: battle, e43: marked, e44: campaign, e45: campaign, e46: Battle, e47: returned, e48: destroyed, e49: fought, e50: encountered, e51: criticised, e52: campaign, e53: refused, e54: employ\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

France had the support of England and Sweden, while the Dutch were supported by Spain, the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark. The war began in May 1672 when France invaded the Netherlands and nearly overran it, an event still referred to as "het Rampjaar" or \'Disaster Year\'. By late July, the Dutch position had stabilised, with support from Emperor Leopold, Brandenburg-Prussia and Spain; this was formalised in the August 1673 Treaty of the Hague, joined by Denmark in January 1674. Faced by a financial crisis, Sweden agreed to remain neutral in return for French subsidies, but became involved in the 1675–1679 Scanian War with its regional rivals Denmark and Brandenburg. On balance, the cost of funding the Swedish army made its support largely negative for France. The period of English participation as an ally of France is also known as the Third Anglo-Dutch War; the alliance was always unpopular and domestic opposition led to its exit in the February 1674 Treaty of Westminster. In November 1677, William of Orange married his cousin Mary, niece to Charles II of England and England agreed a defensive alliance with the Dutch in March 1678. Under the Peace of Nijmegen, France returned Charleroi to Spain. In return, it received the Franche-Comté and cities in Flanders and Hainaut, essentially establishing modern France\'s northern border. However, it also marked the highpoint of French expansion under Louis and William\'s arrival as leader of an anti-French coalition, which would hold together in the 1688–1697 Nine Years War and 1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession.\nevents: t0: 1672, t1: 1678, t2: May 1672, t3: august 1673, t4: january 1674, t5: 1675–1679, t6: february 1674, t7: November 1677, t8: March 1678, t9: 1688–1697, t10: 1701–1714, t11: late july, e0: War, e1: conflict, e2: supported, e3: support, e4: supported, e5: began, e6: invaded, e7: referred, e8: stabilised, e9: support, e10: formalised, e11: joined, e12: agreed, e13: remain, e14: became, e15: involved, e16: made, e17: support, e18: opposition, e19: led to, e20: married, e21: agreed, e22: returned, e23: received, e24: establishing, e25: marked, e26: hold\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It is estimated that three million people perished in this period from violence, famine, or disease in what is considered the second deadliest religious war in European history (surpassed only by the Thirty Years\' War, which took eight million lives). Much of the conflict took place during the long regency of Queen Catherine de\' Medici, widow of Henry II of France, for her minor sons. It also involved a dynastic power struggle between powerful noble families in the line for succession to the French throne: the wealthy, ambitious, and fervently Catholic ducal House of Guise (a cadet branch of the House of Lorraine, who claimed descent from Charlemagne) and their ally Anne de Montmorency, Constable of France (i.e., commander in chief of the French armed forces) versus the less wealthy House of Condé (a branch of the House of Bourbon), princes of the blood in the line of succession to the throne who were sympathetic to Calvinism. Foreign allies provided financing and other assistance to both sides, with Habsburg Spain and the Duchy of Savoy supporting the Guises, and England supporting the Protestant side led by the Condés and by the Protestant Jeanne d\'Albret, wife of Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, and her son, Henry of Navarre. Moderates, primarily associated with the French Valois monarchy and its advisers, tried to balance the situation and avoid open bloodshed. This group (pejoratively known as Politiques) put their hopes in the ability of a strong centralized government to maintain order and harmony. In contrast to the previous hardline policies of Henri II and his father Francis I, they began introducing gradual concessions to Huguenots. A most notable moderate, at least initially, was the queen mother, Catherine de\' Medici. Catherine, however, later hardened her stance and, at the time of the St. Bartholomew\'s Day massacre in 1572, sided with the Guises. This pivotal historical event involved a complete breakdown of state control resulting in series of riots and massacres in which Catholic mobs killed between 5,000 and 30,000 Protestants over a period of weeks throughout the entire kingdom. At the conclusion of the conflict in 1598, the Protestant Henry of Navarre, heir to the French throne, converted to Catholicism and was crowned Henry IV of France. He issued the Edict of Nantes, which granted Huguenots substantial rights and freedoms though this did not end Catholic hostility towards them or towards him, personally. The wars of religion threatened the authority of the monarchy, already fragile under the rule of Catherine\'s three sons and the last Valois kings: Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. This changed under the reign of their Bourbon successor Henry IV. The edict of Nantes was revoked later in 1685 with the Edict of Fontainebleau by Louis XIV of France. Henry IV\'s wise governance and selection of able administrators did leave a legacy of a strong centralized government, stability, and economic prosperity that has gained him the reputation as France\'s best and most beloved monarch, earning him the designation "Good King Henry".\nevents: t0: 1572, t1: 1598, t2: 1685, t3: 1562, t4: 1598, e0: prolonged, e1: war, e2: unrest, e3: perished, e4: violence, e5: war, e6: surpassed, e7: took, e8: conflict, e9: took place, e10: involved, e11: struggle, e12: claimed, e13: armed, e14: provided, e15: assistance, e16: supporting, e17: supporting, e18: associated, e19: avoid, e20: put, e21: maintain, e22: began, e23: hardened, e24: involved, e25: control, e26: resulting in, e27: massacres, e28: killed, e29: conflict, e30: converted, e31: crowned, e32: granted, e33: wars, e34: threatened, e35: changed, e36: revoked, e37: selection, e38: leave, e39: gained, e40: earning\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The festival takes place on a location that emulates a historical 16th century village (Albright) in England during the 1565 fall harvest festival. Renaissance fairs began in the 1960s in California. The Louisiana Renaissance Festival started in 2000 and explores Subcultural movements in Renaissance art, crafts, music, and theatre. Cast members are dressed as people would have been dressed during the 1560s. The local cast at LARF is composed of enthusiasts from all over southeast Louisiana. The cast members regularly interact with the patrons of the fair and have been known to try to marry them, dance with them, bring patrons into random shows, and other mischief. The cast members dress in renaissance inspired clothing. Females wear an underskirt or petticoat with an outer skirt and accessories such as collars. Males wear knee length trousers, stockings, and a shirt. LARF features seven stages with day-long interactive entertainment. There are over 100 merchants offering hand crafted wares. These merchants also provide renaissance clothing, perfumes, ceramic horns, jewelry, and other distinct 16th century gift options. The festival includes lots of food, drink, treats and spirits—both modern and historical. Foods such as jester chips, bread bowls, turkey legs, and gourmet mushrooms are served. There is also a large "living village" reenactment with live cast members ready to show visitors a glimpse of pre-industrial life. While still small in comparison to other older renaissance festivals including the neighboring giant Texas Renaissance Festival whose open season partly overlaps LARF, LARF enjoys a reputation of hospitality that has built a strong base of loyal visitors from all over the country. LARF was opened in 2000 to become Louisiana\'s first public annual renaissance festival. It opens the first weekend in November and runs for the following six weeks, including the Friday after Thanksgiving. LARF is also the last renaissance festival of the year-long season and ends the season with a closing gate jam and firework display over the lake. In 2002 LARF received an award for best New Event of the Year Division, and it has been selected twice as one of the Southeast Tourism Society\'s TOP 20 Events in the Southeast.

It was fought in Europe and the surrounding seas, North America and in India. It is sometimes considered the first global war. The conflict encompassed the Williamite war in Ireland and Jacobite risings in Scotland, where William III and James II struggled for control of England and Ireland, and a campaign in colonial North America between French and English settlers and their respective Indigenous allies, today called King William's War by Americans. Louis XIV of France had emerged from the Franco-Dutch War in 1678 as the most powerful monarch in Europe, an absolute ruler who had won numerous military victories. Using a combination of aggression, annexation, and quasi-legal means, Louis XIV set about extending his gains to stabilize and strengthen France's frontiers, culminating in the brief War of the Reunions (1683–1684). The Truce of Ratisbon guaranteed France's new borders for twenty years, but Louis XIV's subsequent actions—notably his Edict of Fontainebleau (the revocation of the Edict of Nantes) in 1685—led to the deterioration of his military and political dominance. Louis XIV's decision to cross the Rhine in September 1688 was designed to extend his influence and pressure the Holy Roman Empire into accepting his territorial and dynastic claims. Leopold I and the German princes resolved to resist, and when the States General and William III brought the Dutch and the English into the war against France, the French king faced a powerful coalition aimed at curtailing his ambitions. The main fighting took place around France's borders in the Spanish Netherlands, the Rhineland, the Duchy of Savoy and Catalonia. The fighting generally favoured Louis XIV's armies, but by 1696 his country was in the grip of an economic crisis. The Maritime Powers (England and the Dutch Republic) were also financially exhausted, and when Savoy defected from the Alliance, all parties were keen to negotiate a settlement. By the terms of the Treaty of Ryswick (1697) Louis XIV retained the whole of Alsace but was forced to return Lorraine to its ruler and give up any gains on the right bank of the Rhine. Louis XIV also accepted William III as the rightful King of England, while the Dutch acquired a Barrier fortress system in the Spanish Netherlands to help secure their borders. With the ailing and childless Charles II of Spain approaching his end, a new conflict over the inheritance of the Spanish Empire embroiled Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance in the War of the Spanish Succession.\nevents: t0: 1688–1697, t1: 1678, t2: 1683–1684, t3: September 1688, t4: 1696, t5: 1697, t6: twenty years, e0: called, e1: conflict, e2: fought, e3: encompassed, e4: struggled, e5: called, e6: emerged, e7: set about, e8: extending, e9: guaranteed, e10: decision, e11: designed, e12: accepting, e13: resolved, e14: brought, e15: war, e16: aimed, e17: took place, e18: fighting, e19: favoured, e20: exhausted, e21: defected, e22: retained, e23: forced, e24: give up, e25: accepted, e26: acquired, e27: help, e28: ailing, e29: approaching, e30: conflict, e31: embroiled\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The campaign involved commerce raiding by detached forces and two minor engagements, eventually culminating in the full fleet action of the Glorious First of June 1794, at which both fleets were badly mauled and both Britain and France claimed victory. The French lost seven battleships; the British none, but the battle distracted the British fleet long enough for the French convoy to safely reach port. By the spring of 1794, the French Republic, under the rule of the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an infusion of grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by Lord Howe, knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with the main body of the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the weather gage from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack. The culminating action of the campaign took place over into the Atlantic, and became known as the Glorious First of June. This final engagement saw Howe use the weather gage to attack Villaret directly while his opponent attempted to fight in a traditional line of battle formation. In the battle, the British fleet inflicted a heavy defeat on the French after a bitterly contested day of fighting. Forcing Villaret to retreat, Howe's force captured seven French battleships, one of which later sank, and inflicted 7,000 casualties on the enemy. Villaret however, claimed strategic success as his delaying tactics had bought enough time for the convoy to reach France safely. The battle was the first in a series of defeats the French Navy suffered during the early years of the war, which bred a defeatist attitude and an unwillingness among the French officer corps to engage the British at sea.\nevents: t0: May 1794, t1: June 1794, t2: the spring of 1794, t3: April , May and June, t4: over a week, t5: 28, t6: 29 May, t7: June, e0: campaign, e1: operations, e2: conducted, e3: preventing, e4: travelling, e5: campaign, e6: involved, e7: raiding, e8: engagements, e9: culminating, e10: mauled, e11: claimed, e12: victory, e13: lost, e14: battle, e15: distracted, e16: reach, e17: war, e18: famine, e19: looked, e20: provide, e21: convoyed, e22: supported, e23: upheaval, e24: reduced, e25: fight, e26: supply, e27: shortages, e28: devastated, e29: weakening, e30: command, e31: suffering, e32: shortage, e33: trained, e34: tasked, e35: keeping, e36: occupied, e37: reach, e38: commanded, e39: knew, e40: dispatched, e41: protect, e42: pursuing, e43: manoeuvred, e44: drawing, e45: seized, e46: granting, e47: choose, e48: attack, e49: culminating, e50: took place, e51: became, e52: engagement, e53: attack, e54: fight, e55: battle, e56: battle, e57: inflicted, e58: defeat, e59: contested, e60: fighting, e61: Forcing, e62: retreat, e63: captured, e64: sank, e65: inflicted, e66: casualties, e67: claimed, e68: success, e69: delaying, e70: bought, e71: reach, e72: battle, e73: defeats, e74: suffered, e75: war, e76: bred, e77: engage\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

It came less than three months after Minh\'s junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ngô Đình Diệm. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours—after power had been seized Minh\'s aide and bodyguard, Major Nguyễn Văn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed. Distrusted by his colleagues because of his tendency to change sides and his reputation as an intriguer, Khánh was assigned to I Corps in the far north of the country after Diệm\'s overthrow to keep him away from the capital Saigon. Khánh, who had played a minor role in Diệm\'s overthrow, joined forces with Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, who felt they deserved better posts in the junta, and Colonels Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Đỗ Mậu, the latter being the director of military security under Diệm and an effective strategist. During the three months of his rule, Minh, his civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, and his leading military colleagues, Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim, attempted to defeat the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) non-militarily. They felt that a battleground victory was impractical or impossible and pursued a strategy of trying to politically integrate the insurgents into the mainstream. This meant an intensification of rural non-military initiatives and a reduction in armed operations. This brought them into conflict with the United States, who had plans to start bombing North Vietnam. At the same time, in January 1964, the French government of President Charles de Gaulle proposed the neutralization of Vietnam and the withdrawal of American forces. Khánh and his fellow plotters exploited this to spread rumors that Minh\'s junta was about to make a deal with Hanoi and then gained the support of the US, most notably through the chief of military forces in Vietnam, General Paul Harkins, who supported Diệm and opposed Minh\'s November coup. Before dawn on January 30, the coup forces caught the junta completely off-guard and seized power without a fight. Khánh grudgingly decided to keep Minh as a figurehead chief of state while maintaining real power in his hands as Minh was popular within the army and the Americans wanted a show of unity to be maintained. Khánh also tried to consolidate his standing in the military by promoting a group of younger officers, and increasing the pay of the enlisted men. In the meantime, the other key generals in the junta, Don, Kim, Đính and Xuân were put under house arrest, accused by Khánh of attempting to negotiate a peace deal with North Vietnam. However, when they were brought to a military trial presided over by Khánh, the junta leader did not provide any evidence and convicted them of "lax morality". Khánh then allowed them back to meaningless desk jobs, but the show trial brought him much embarrassment. Khánh later admitted that there was no basis to the charges of neutralism against the four generals, and after a tumultuous year in power, Khánh was himself deposed in February 1965 and forced into exile.\nevents: t0: January 30 , 1964, t1: january 1964, t2: January 30, t3: February 1965, t4: less than three months, e0: ousted, e1: took, e2: seized, e3: arrested, e4: Distrusted, e5: assigned, e6: overthrow, e7: overthrow, e8: joined, e9: felt, e10: attempted, e11: defeat, e12: felt, e13: pursued, e14: integrate, e15: armed, e16: withdrawal, e17: decided, e18: maintained, e19: promoting, e20: accused, e21: brought, e22: allowed, e23: forced\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Two police officers, Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded after receiving a police dispatch call regarding a black male that "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing "a pistol" at random people at the Cudell Recreation Center, a park in the City of Cleveland\'s Public Works Department. At the beginning of the call and again in the middle, he says of the pistol "it\'s probably fake". Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller states that "he is probably a juvenile"; however, this information was not relayed to officers Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled "show me your hands" through the open patrol car window. Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw: "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day. Rice\'s gun was later found to be an airsoft replica that lacked the orange-tipped barrel, which would have indicated it being a nonlethal gun. A surveillance video of the incident was released by police four days after the shooting, on 26 November. On 3 June 2015, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff\'s Office released a statement in which they declared their investigation to be completed and that they had turned their findings over to the county prosecutor. Several months later, the prosecution presented evidence to a grand jury, which declined to indict, primarily on the basis that Rice was drawing what appears to be an actual firearm from his waist as the police arrived. A lawsuit brought against the city of Cleveland by Rice\'s family was subsequently settled for $6 million in an effort to reduce taxpayer liabilities. In the aftermath of the shooting, it was revealed that Loehmann, in his previous job as a police officer in the Cleveland suburb of Independence, had been deemed an emotionally unstable recruit and unfit for duty. Loehmann did not disclose this fact on his application to join the Cleveland police, and Cleveland police never reviewed his previous personnel file before hiring him.

At the time of European contact, the islands were divided amongst competing Ali'i, or high chiefs. The Island of Hawai'i was divided into several districts, Moloka'i, Lana'i, and Kaho'olawe were united under Maui, O'ahu was independent, and Kauai ruled Ni'ihau. The feudal Ali'i often fought wars to gain land and mana; however the introduction of European weapons gave some Ali'i an advantage over others, and they began aggressively taking over their neighbors. First the big island was consolidated by Kamehameha I after overthrowing his uncle for control of the Kona Hawaii. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Maui invaded and conquered O'ahu. With Hawai'i united under his rule, Kamehameha eventually invaded Maui and Oahu, culminating in the climatic battle that was the Battle of Nu'uanu. Before he could successfully invade the last two remaining islands, the paramount Chief of Kaua'i, Kaumuali'i, negotiated a peace that submitted the islands to Hawai'ian rule.\nevents: t0: 1782–1810, t1: the time, e0: fought, e1: competing, e2: united, e3: gain, e4: gave, e5: began, e6: taking over, e7: consolidated, e8: overthrowing, e9: invaded, e10: conquered, e11: united, e12: invaded, e13: invade, e14: negotiated, e15: submitted\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

It is also the second-largest state fair in the United States by total attendance, trailing only the State Fair of Texas, which generally runs twice as long as the Minnesota State Fair. The state fairgrounds, adjacent the Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota, are in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, midway between the state\'s capital city of St. Paul and the adjacent city of Roseville, near the Como Park and Saint Anthony Park neighborhoods of Saint Paul. Residents of the state and region come to the fair to be entertained, exhibit their best livestock, show off their abilities in a variety of fields including art and cooking, learn about new products and services, and eat many different types of food—often on a stick. The fair runs for twelve days from late August into early September, ending on Labor Day. The Minnesota State Fair was named the best state fair in the United States in 2015 by readers of USA Today. The Minnesota State Fair is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area. Around two million people attend the Fair annually. Attendance in 2019 was a record 2,126,551 people.

Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio López de Santa Anna reclaimed the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de Béxar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States), killing the Texian and immigrant occupiers. Santa Anna\'s cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians, both legal Texas settlers and illegal immigrants from the United States, to join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the rebellion. Several months previously, Texians had driven all Mexican troops out of Mexican Texas. About 100 Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo. The Texian force grew slightly with the arrival of reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Béxar as the first step in a campaign to retake Texas. For the next 10 days, the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties. Aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by such a large force, Travis wrote multiple letters pleading for more men and supplies from Texas and from the United States, but the Texians were reinforced by fewer than 100 men because the United States had a treaty with Mexico, and supplying men and weapons would have been an overt act of war. In the early morning hours of March 6, the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo. After repelling two attacks, the Texians were unable to fend off a third attack. As Mexican soldiers scaled the walls, most of the Texian fighters withdrew into interior buildings. Occupiers unable to reach these points were slain by the Mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape. Between five and seven Texians may have surrendered; if so, they were quickly executed. Most eyewitness accounts reported between 182 and 257 Texians died, while most historians of the Alamo agree that around 600 Mexicans were killed or wounded. Several noncombatants were sent to Gonzales to spread word of the Texian defeat. The news sparked both a strong rush to join the Texian army and a panic, known as "The Runaway Scrape", in which the Texian army, most settlers, and the new, self-proclaimed but officially unrecognized, Republic of Texas government fled eastward toward the United States ahead of the advancing Mexican Army. Within Mexico, the battle has often been overshadowed by events from the Mexican–American War of 1846–48. In 19th-century Texas, the Alamo complex gradually became known as a battle site rather than a former mission. The Texas Legislature purchased the land and buildings in the early part of the 20th century and designated the Alamo chapel as an official Texas State Shrine. The Alamo has been the subject of numerous non-fiction works beginning in 1843. Most Americans, however, are more familiar with the myths and legends spread by many of the movie and television adaptations, including the 1950s Disney mini-series "Davy Crockett" and John Wayne\'s 1960 film "The Alamo".\nevents: t0: february 23, t1: march 6 , 1836, t2: 13-day, t3: April 21 , 1836, t4: Several months previously, t5: February 23, t6: the next 10 days, t7: 1846–48, t8: 1843, t9: 1960, t10: the early morning hours of March 6, t11: 19th-century, t12: the 1950s, e0: battle, e1: event, e2: revolution, e3: reclaimed, e4: killing, e5: battle, e6: inspired, e7: join, e8: revenge, e9: defeated, e10: Battle, e11: ending, e12: rebellion, e13: driven, e14: garrisoned, e15: grew, e16: arrival, e17: led, e18: marched, e19: campaign, e20: retake, e21: engaged, e22: skirmishes, e23: casualties, e24: attack, e25: wrote, e26: pleading, e27: reinforced, e28: supplying, e29: war, e30: advanced, e31: repelling, e32: attacks, e33: fend, e34: attack, e35: scaled, e36: withdrew, e37: reach, e38: slain, e39: escape, e40: surrendered, e41: executed, e42: reported, e43: died, e44: agree, e45: killed, e46: wounded, e47: sent, e48: spread, e49: defeat, e50: sparked, e51: rush, e52: join, e53: self-proclaimed, e54: fled, e55: advancing, e56: battle, e57: War, e58: battle, e59: purchased, e60: designated, e61: beginning, e62: spread\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The engagement was one of several between rival frigate squadrons contesting control of the French island base of Île de France, from which French frigates had raided British trade routes during the war. The action came in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Grand Port, in which four British frigates had been lost, and just four days after a fifth British frigate had been captured and subsequently recaptured in the Action of 13 September 1810. In consequence of the heavy losses the British force had suffered, reinforcements were hastily rushed to the area and became individual targets for the larger French squadron blockading the British base at Île Bourbon. HMS "Ceylon" had been despatched by the British authorities at Madras after the Battle of Grand Port to reinforce the remains of the squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley on Île Bourbon. Searching for Rowley off Île de France, "Ceylon" was spotted by French Commodore Jacques Hamelin who gave chase in his flagship "Vénus", supported by a corvette. "Vénus" was faster than "Ceylon", and although Captain Charles Gordon almost reached the safety of Île Bourbon, he was run down and forced to engage the French ship during the night, both frigates inflicting severe damage on one another before the wounded Gordon surrendered to the approaching corvette. As dawn broke, Rowley\'s flagship HMS "Boadicea" arrived, recaptured "Ceylon", drove off the corvette and forced the battered French flagship to surrender, capturing Hamelin. This was the last ship-to-ship action in the region before the successful invasion of Île de France in December 1810: without Hamelin the French squadron, short on supplies and low on morale, did not contest British control of the region and failed to even attempt to disrupt the invasion fleet.\nevents: t0: 18 September 1810, t1: 13 September 1810, t2: December 1810, e0: battle, e1: fought, e2: Wars, e3: engagement, e4: contesting, e5: control, e6: raided, e7: war, e8: came, e9: Battle, e10: lost, e11: captured, e12: recaptured, e13: losses, e14: suffered, e15: reinforcements, e16: rushed, e17: became, e18: blockading, e19: despatched, e20: Battle, e21: reinforce, e22: spotted, e23: chase, e24: supported, e25: reached, e26: run, e27: forced, e28: engage, e29: inflicting, e30: damage, e31: wounded, e32: surrendered, e33: broke, e34: arrived, e35: recaptured, e36: drove, e37: forced, e38: surrender, e39: capturing, e40: invasion, e41: contest, e42: control, e43: failed, e44: attempt, e45: disrupt, e46: invasion\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

A comprehensive search of a wide area (including what is now known to have been the crash site) was fruitless, and the fate of the aircraft and its occupants remained unknown for over 50 years, giving rise to various conspiracy theories about its disappearance. In the late 1990s, pieces of wreckage from the missing aircraft began to emerge from the glacial ice. It is now believed that the crew became confused as to their exact location while flying at high altitudes through the (then poorly understood) jet stream. Mistakenly believing they had already cleared the mountain tops, they started their descent when they were in fact still behind cloud-covered peaks, and "Star Dust" crashed into Mount Tupungato, killing all aboard and burying itself in snow and ice.

The preceding six years of occupation had fuelled anti-German sentiment and the approach of the Soviet Red Army and the US Third Army offered a chance of success. On 5 May 1945, in the last moments of the war in Europe, Czech citizens spontaneously attacked the German occupiers and Czech resistance leaders emerged from hiding to join the uprising. The Russian Liberation Army, which had been fighting for the Germans, defected and supported the Czechs. German troops counter-attacked, but their progress was slowed by barricades constructed by the Czech citizenry. On 8 May, the Czech and German leaders signed a ceasefire allowing the German forces to withdraw from the city, but not all Waffen-SS units obeyed. Fighting continued until 9 May, when the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city. The uprising was brutal, with both sides committing war crimes. Violence against Germans, sanctioned by the Czechoslovak government, continued after the liberation, and was justified as revenge for the occupation or as a means to encourage Germans to flee. George Patton’s US Third Army was ordered by General Dwight Eisenhower not to come to the aid of the Czech insurgents, which undermined the credibility of the Western powers in postwar Czechoslovakia. Instead, the uprising was presented as a symbol of Czech resistance to Nazi rule, and the liberation by the Red Army was exploited by the Czechoslovak Communist Party to increase popular support for communism.\nevents: t0: World War II, t1: 1945, t2: 5 May 1945, t3: six years, t4: 8 May, t5: 9 May, e0: fuelled, e1: approach, e2: offered, e3: attacked, e4: emerged, e5: hiding, e6: join, e7: uprising, e8: fighting, e9: defected, e10: supported, e11: counter-attacked, e12: slowed, e13: signed, e14: withdraw, e15: obeyed, e16: entered, e17: crimes, e18: justified, e19: revenge, e20: flee, e21: ordered, e22: aid, e23: presented, e24: increase\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The attack was one of a series of strikes against the battleship launched from aircraft carriers between April and August 1944, and was initiated after Allied intelligence determined that the damage inflicted during the Operation Tungsten raid on 3 April had been repaired. A force of 44 British dive bombers and 40 fighters took off from three aircraft carriers in the early hours of 17 July. German radar stations detected these aircraft while they were en route to Kaafjord, and "Tirpitz" was protected by a smoke screen by the time the strike force arrived. Few of the British airmen were able to spot the battleship, and their attacks did not inflict any significant damage. German losses were limited to a patrol craft, and three British aircraft were destroyed or damaged beyond repair by Kaafjord\'s defenders. A group of German submarines attempted to intercept the carrier force as it returned to base, without success. Two U-boats were sunk near the carriers by British patrol aircraft and several others were damaged. In August 1944, the Royal Navy conducted Operation Goodwood, four more carrier raids against "Tirpitz" which also failed and the task of sinking the battleship was transferred to the Royal Air Force.\nevents: t0: 17 July 1944, t1: August 1944, t2: April, t3: 3 April, t4: august 1944, t5: the early hours of 17 July, e0: raid, e1: conducted, e2: attack, e3: strikes, e4: launched, e5: initiated, e6: determined, e7: inflicted, e8: raid, e9: detected, e10: protected, e11: arrived, e12: spot, e13: attacks, e14: inflict, e15: damage, e16: losses, e17: limited, e18: destroyed, e19: damaged, e20: intercept, e21: returned, e22: damaged, e23: conducted, e24: raids, e25: failed, e26: transferred\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The objective of the offensive was to re-establish a road link between the city of Banja Luka in the west of the country and the eastern parts of the territory controlled by the Bosnian Serbs. The offensive was prompted by the capture of Derventa by the HV and the HVO – a move that blocked the single overland road between the VRS-controlled territories. The VRS successfully recaptured Derventa and pushed the HVO and the HV north, capturing several towns in the process. In the second phase of the offensive, the VRS reached the Sava River, the border with Croatia, and destroyed a bridgehead held by the HV and the HVO at Bosanski Brod. The offensive involved more than 60,000 troops and resulted in heavy casualties for all sides, especially the HVO. The Croatian National Defence Council commissioned a report into the loss of Bosanska Posavina and blamed internal conflicts, a double chain of command and ineffective counterintelligence for the defeat. The outcome later caused speculation that it was the result of a political arrangement between Serb and Croatian leaders to secure a land trade, though a Central Intelligence Agency analysis rejected such allegations.\nevents: t0: 24 June, t1: 6 October 1992, e0: Operation, e1: conducted, e2: re-establish, e3: controlled, e4: prompted, e5: capture, e6: blocked, e7: recaptured, e8: pushed, e9: capturing, e10: reached, e11: destroyed, e12: held, e13: involved, e14: resulted in, e15: casualties, e16: blamed, e17: conflicts, e18: command, e19: caused, e20: secure, e21: rejected, e22: allegations\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The Games were held in Paris, France, from 10 to 17 August 1924, as an equivalent to the Olympic Games for deaf athletes. They were organised on the initiative of deaf Frenchman Eugène Rubens-Alcais, who, just after the Games, co-founded the Comité International des Sports des Sourds with other "deaf sporting leaders". (Rubens-Alcais had previously founded France\'s first sports federation for the deaf and mute, in 1918.) The 1924 Games were "the first games ever" for athletes with a disability, preceding the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games in 1948, which became the Paralympic Games in 1960 but which did not include events for deaf athletes. These First Silent Games were held just two weeks after the end of the 1924 Summer Olympics, also in Paris. The Games for the deaf were "modelled on the Olympic Games". Nine countries, "including six official national federations already in existence", sent 148 athletes to compete, in seven sports: athletics, road cycling, diving, football, shooting, swimming, and tennis. Demonstration events were also held in gymnastics. Not counting gymnastics, a total of 31 events were held. Specifically, France, Belgium, Great Britain, Latvia, the Netherlands, and Poland "already had a sports federation" for the deaf, while Italy, Romania and Hungary each sent one athlete despite having no such federation yet. There were 147 male athletes, and only one female athlete: Hendrika Nicoline Van der Heyden, of the Netherlands. She "competed" alone in the 100m backstroke event for women in swimming, completing it in 2:03.6, which set a world record. It was the only walkover, as there were at least two competitors in each of the men\'s thirty events (three competitors in all but one). The host country, France, dominated, winning sixteen of the seventeen events in athletics; the sole exception was the javelin throw, where Belgian Nicolas François came first ahead of Frenchman Raymond Code. Frenchman Émile Van den Torren won the most events overall, coming first in the 1,500 metres, 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres in athletics. France also swept up all three gold medals in cycling, the only gold medal in shooting, one of the two gold in tennis, and won the football competition. By contrast, the six swimming events were much more open; France won none, and the six gold medals were shared between the Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom (competing as "Great Britain"). The British also won one of the tennis events: the men\'s doubles. The Games were deemed a success, and a second edition was held four years later in Amsterdam, with 212 athletes from ten nations – including, this time, fourteen women. (Amsterdam also held the Olympic Games that year.) With the 1924 Games being the first in a regular series, the International Games for the Deaf were established as "the second oldest international multi-sport event in the world", after the Olympic Games.\nevents: t0: 10, t1: 17 August 1924, t2: 1918, t3: 1924, t4: 1948, t5: 1960, t6: 1924, t7: 1924, t8: 1924, t9: four years later, t10: that year, e0: referred, e1: organised, e2: co-founded, e3: founded, e4: games, e5: became, e6: held, e7: end, e8: sent, e9: compete, e10: shooting, e11: held, e12: held, e13: sent, e14: competed, e15: completing, e16: winning, e17: came, e18: coming, e19: swept, e20: competition, e21: held, e22: held, e23: established\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The seventh named storm of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season, Dolphin formed on May 6 in the vicinity of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Moving eastward at first, the storm slowly organized before beginning a north and west-northwest trajectory. Dolphin intensified into a typhoon before passing between Guam and Rota on May 15, producing typhoon-force winds on both islands. It later rapidly intensified as it curved to the north. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated Dolphin as a super typhoon, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated 10 minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Dolphin turned to the northeast and weakened, becoming extratropical on May 20 and exiting the western Pacific basin on May 24. The storm first affected the FSM, notably Pohnpei where it dropped of rainfall over three days. The rains and gusty winds knocked down many trees on the island, one of which killed a person, and causing $1 million in damage (2015 USD). Dolphin passed between Guam and Rota, producing gusts of at Andersen Air Force Base on northern Guam. The winds left 40% of the island without power and left at least 3,300 people without water. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall, flooding Guam Memorial Hospital. Dolphin damaged 390 houses, including nine that were destroyed, leaving 1,055 people homeless.

Ironically, the besieging army included a contingent from the Byzantine Empire, which by then was a vassal of the Ottomans. Prior to its fall, the city had evaded the fate of her neighbours by paying tribute to the numerous fanatical ghazis, whose bands robbed and pillaged any who did not pay protection money ("jizya"), although the city was not officially under Islamic law. In theory, the city was under the Byzantine Empire, but cut off by a sea of hostile land ensured that in reality the city remained independent. In 1378 Manuel II Palaiologos promised to hand over the city of Philadelphia to the Turks in return for the Ottoman sultan\'s aid in a disastrous Byzantine civil war. However, Manuel seems to have retracted his promise, since it was not until 1390 that Bayezid summoned the two leaders of the civil war, John VII and Manuel II, and ordered them to accompany the besieging force.

The Boeing 707–328 aircraft involved in the accident was just four months old. The flight was uneventful until approaching Pointe-à-Pitre. The airport is surrounded by mountains and requires a steep descent. The weather was poor – violent thunderstorm and low cloud ceiling. The VOR navigational beacon was out of service. The crew reported themselves over the non-directional beacon (NDB) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and turned east to begin the final approach. Due to incorrect automatic direction finder (ADF) readings caused by the thunderstorm, the plane strayed 15 km (9.3 mi) west from the procedural let-down track. The plane crashed in a forest on a hill called "Dos D\'Ane" ("The Donkey\'s Back"), at about 1,400 feet (427 m) and exploded. There were no survivors. Among the dead was French Guianan politician and war hero Justin Catayée and poet and black-consciousness activist Paul Niger. The investigation could not determine the exact reason for the accident, but suspected the insufficient meteorological information given to the crew, failure of the ground equipment, and the atmospheric effects on the ADF indicator. After the crash Air France pilots criticized under-developed airports with facilities that were ill-equipped to handle jet aircraft, such as Guadeloupe\'s airport. This was the second accident in less than three weeks with an Air France Boeing 707 after the crash on 3 June 1962. Tex Johnston, Chief Test Pilot of Boeing Aircraft Co. wrote in his autobiography of events leading up to the crash. "Air France flight crews were habitually late (for crew training by Boeing), and on occasion the airplane not serviced. ... After much extra, and in my mind, excessive flight training, the chief pilot failed to qualify." He informed the Air France Chief Executive in writing "I did not believe the captain capable of qualifying in the 707." Later "... an Air France instructor qualified the chief pilot. On his second trip as captain, he missed an inclement weather approach... and crashed into a mountain." Some debris still remain at the site, where a memorial monument was placed in 2002 to mark the 40th anniversary of the crash. The road leading to the site is named Route du Boeing in memory of the crash. Air France currently uses this flight number on a Shanghai–Pudong to Paris–Charles de Gaulle flight using a Boeing 777.\nevents: t0: 22 june 1962, t1: 3 June 1962, t2: 2002, t3: four months, e0: crashed, e1: accident, e2: surrounded, e3: requires, e4: descent, e5: service, e6: reported, e7: turned, e8: begin, e9: approach, e10: caused, e11: strayed, e12: crashed, e13: exploded, e14: dead, e15: investigation, e16: determine, e17: accident, e18: suspected, e19: given, e20: crash, e21: criticized, e22: handle, e23: accident, e24: crash, e25: wrote in, e26: crash, e27: serviced, e28: failed, e29: informed, e30: qualified, e31: approach, e32: crashed, e33: monument, e34: crash, e35: named, e36: crash, e37: uses\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The match was to decide the winner of the 2011–12 season of the UEFA Champions League, Europe's premier club football tournament. Bayern were making their ninth appearance in the competition's final, having won four and lost four, most recently losing in 2010. Chelsea were appearing in their second final, having lost their first in 2008. It was the first Champions League final to be held at the Allianz Arena (known as Fußball Arena München for the final). As tenants of the Arena, this meant Bayern were the first finalists to have home advantage since 1984. Both teams progressed to the knockout stages by finishing top of their group. Bayern then beat Basel, Marseille and Real Madrid to reach the final, while Chelsea knocked out Napoli, Benfica and defending champions Barcelona. Bayern took the lead late in the second half through Thomas Müller, but Didier Drogba equalised for Chelsea five minutes later to take the game to extra time, in which Arjen Robben missed an awarded penalty, Petr Čech saving the low drive. The teams stayed level at 1–1 and the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which Chelsea won 4–3 to clinch their first Champions League title. In doing so, they became the first London club to win the tournament, the fifth English club and 22nd overall. As winners, Chelsea took part in the 2012 UEFA Super Cup, losing 4–1 to Atlético Madrid, the winners of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. The victory also allowed them to enter the following season's Champions League competition (having failed to qualify for it by their league finishing position) at the expense of London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who would otherwise have entered the competition having finished fourth in the Premier League. Chelsea also represented UEFA at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup, entering at the semi-final stage; however, they were beaten 1–0 by Corinthians in the final.\nevents: t0: Saturday , 19 May 2012, t1: 2010, t2: 2008, t3: 1984, t4: 2012, t5: 2011–12, t6: 2012, t7: 2011–12, t8: 2012, e0: match, e1: took place, e2: match, e3: decide, e4: appearance, e5: lost, e6: losing, e7: appearing, e8: lost, e9: final, e10: held, e11: progressed, e12: finishing, e13: beat, e14: reach, e15: took, e16: take, e17: missed, e18: penalty, e19: saving, e20: match, e21: went to, e22: shoot-out, e23: clinch, e24: became, e25: win, e26: tournament, e27: losing, e28: allowed, e29: enter, e30: failed, e31: entered, e32: competition, e33: finished, e34: represented, e35: entering, e36: beaten\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

It was formed as a result of the first Constituent Assembly election held on April 10, 2008. The Constituent Assembly was tasked with writing a new constitution, and acting as the interim legislature for a term of two years. 240 members were elected in single seat constituencies, 335 were elected through proportional representation, and the remaining 26 seats were reserved for nominated members. The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN (M)) was the largest party in the Constituent Assembly, having won half of the constituency seats and about 30% of proportional representation seats. The Constituent Assembly declared a republic at its first meeting on May 28, 2008, abolishing the monarchy. In late June 2008, the parties agreed to divide the 26 nominated seats in the Constituent Assembly between nine parties: the CPN (M) was to receive nine of these seats, while the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN (UML)) (which respectively placed second and third in the election) would each receive five, the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum would receive two, and the Sadbhavana Party, the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, Janamorcha Nepal, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) would each receive one nominated seat. Due to its failure in drafting a new constitution, the CA was dissolved on May 28, 2012 after its original and extended total tenure of 4 years. The next Nepalese Constituent Assembly elections initially slated for November 22, 2012 were held a year later on November 19, 2013 after being postponed several times. Opening of the Constituent Assembly, declaration of the Republic. The official and final list of members elected under the PR system was released on 8 May 2008; this meant the first meeting of the CA (which has to be held within 21 days of the publication of the final result) would be held before the end of May 2008. On 12 May 2008, it was announced that the first session of the CA would be held on 28 May 2008. The members of the CA were sworn in on 27 May 2008. The composition of CA looked like this: At the first session of the Constituent Assembly on 28 May, it voted to declare Nepal a federal democratic republic, thereby abolishing the monarchy. 564 members of the Constituent Assembly voted on this motion, with 560 in favor and four opposed. Of all the parties represented in the Constituent Assembly, only the Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal (RPP-Nepal) opposed the motion. Koirala said that Nepal was entering a new era and that "the nation\'s dream has come true", while celebrations took place in Kathmandu; May 29 and May 30 were declared to be public holidays by the government. The Constituent Assembly also decided that Gyanendra should leave the Narayanhity Palace within 15 days. Earlier on 28 May, the major parties agreed on the creation of the position of President, while the Prime Minister was to hold executive powers; however, they reached no agreement on exactly what powers the President should have or who should become President, and these deliberations led to a delay in the opening of the Constituent Assembly. On 29 May, the royal standard was removed from Narayanhity Palace and replaced with the national flag. Gyanendra reportedly said on 2 June that he accepted the Constituent Assembly\'s decision.\nevents: t0: may 28 , 2008, t1: may 28 , 2012, t2: april 10 , 2008, t3: two years, t4: may 28 , 2008, t5: late june 2008, t6: May 28 , 2012, t7: 4 years, t8: november 22 , 2012, t9: november 19 , 2013, t10: 8 May 2008, t11: the end of May 2008, t12: 28 May 2008, t13: 27 May 2008, t14: 28 may, t15: May 29, t16: May 30, t17: 29 May, t18: 2 june, t19: 21 days, t20: 12 May 2008, t21: 15 days, t22: 28 may, e0: assembly, e1: served, e2: formed, e3: assembly, e4: election, e5: held, e6: assembly, e7: tasked, e8: writing, e9: acting, e10: elected, e11: elected, e12: reserved, e13: declared, e14: meeting, e15: abolishing, e16: agreed, e17: assembly, e18: receive, e19: placed, e20: election, e21: receive, e22: receive, e23: receive, e24: failure, e25: drafting, e26: dissolved, e27: assembly, e28: elections, e29: slated, e30: held, e31: postponed, e32: opening, e33: assembly, e34: declaration, e35: elected, e36: released, e37: meeting, e38: held, e39: publication, e40: held, e41: announced, e42: session, e43: held, e44: sworn, e45: looked, e46: session, e47: assembly, e48: voted, e49: declare, e50: abolishing, e51: voted, e52: favor, e53: opposed, e54: assembly, e55: opposed, e56: said, e57: entering, e58: took place, e59: declared, e60: assembly, e61: decided, e62: leave, e63: agreed, e64: creation, e65: hold, e66: reached, e67: agreement, e68: become, e69: led to, e70: delay, e71: opening, e72: assembly, e73: removed, e74: said, e75: accepted, e76: assembly, e77: decision\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The campaign developed as French forces based on Île de France reacted more quickly than the British forces in the Indian Ocean to the expansion of the French Revolutionary Wars on 1 February 1793. French privateers rapidly spread along the British trade routes in the Far East, becoming concentrated around the narrow Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. These ships were soon joined by French Navy frigates and began to inflict losses on shipping in the region. The Royal Navy forces in the Indian Ocean were deployed elsewhere and so the East India Company, the private enterprise that ruled much of British India in the 1790s and maintained their own fleet and navy, raised a squadron of armed merchant ships to patrol the Strait and drive off the raiders. The arrival of this British force on 2 January 1794 was initially a success, the squadron over-running and capturing two large and well-armed privateers on 22 January, not long after the French vessels had been beaten off during an attack on the British trading post at Bencoolen. On 24 January an action against a larger French squadron was fought in the Strait itself, but ended inconclusively and the squadrons divided, the British receiving the Dutch frigate "Amazone" as reinforcements. The French subsequently turned southwards out of the Strait and attacked Bencoolen again on 9 February, capturing an East Indiaman in the harbour before returning to Île de France with their prize.\nevents: t0: 1 February 1793, t1: 2 January 1794, t2: 22 January, t3: 24 January, t4: 9 February, t5: January 1794, t6: the 1790s, e0: fought, e1: sent, e2: protect, e3: augmented, e4: developed, e5: reacted, e6: expansion, e7: spread, e8: joined, e9: began, e10: losses, e11: deployed, e12: maintained, e13: raised, e14: armed, e15: drive, e16: arrival, e17: success, e18: capturing, e19: beaten, e20: attack, e21: fought, e22: ended, e23: receiving, e24: turned, e25: attacked, e26: capturing, e27: returning\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The ninth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Iris developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles on August 22 and attained hurricane status within 30 hours. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern Caribbean from August 26 through August 28. During that time, Iris became one of four active tropical storms in the Atlantic basin. Earlier it had interacted with Hurricane Humberto, and beginning on August 30, Iris interacted with Tropical Storm Karen. Iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) while moving slowly across the central Atlantic. The hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating Karen on September 3. Iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September 4, though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western Europe on September 7. As a tropical storm, Iris produced heavy rainfall across much of the Leeward Islands. In the southern Lesser Antilles, high waves caused coastal flooding in Trinidad, while in Martinique further north, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. The threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on Montserrat, which was being threatened by the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. There were five deaths in association with Iris—four in Martinique, and one in Guadeloupe.\nevents: t0: August 22, t1: 30 hours, t2: august 30, t3: September 3, t4: September 7, t5: September 4, t6: August 26, t7: August 28, e0: Hurricane, e1: affect, e2: hurricanes, e3: storm, e4: hurricane, e5: hurricane, e6: developed, e7: attained, e8: hurricane, e9: weakened, e10: storm, e11: crossing, e12: became, e13: storms, e14: interacted, e15: hurricane, e16: beginning, e17: interacted, e18: storm, e19: re-intensified, e20: hurricane, e21: attained, e22: moving, e23: hurricane, e24: accelerated, e25: absorbed, e26: dissipating, e27: weakened, e28: storm, e29: became, e30: affecting, e31: storm, e32: produced, e33: caused, e34: flooding, e35: led to, e36: flooding, e37: hurricane, e38: halted, e39: evacuations, e40: threatened, e41: eruption, e42: deaths\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The bus was carrying 42 Israelis, mainly youths, from the airport to their hotels, after arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. The explosion killed the Bulgarian bus driver and five Israelis and injured 32 Israelis, resulting in international condemnation of the bombing. In February 2013, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, the Bulgarian Interior Minister, said there was "well-grounded" evidence that Hezbollah was behind the attack. Tsvetanov stated that the two suspects had Canadian and Australian passports and lived in Lebanon. According to the Europol, forensic evidence and intelligence sources all point to Hezbollah\'s involvement in the blast. Both Iran and Hezbollah have denied any involvement. On 5 June 2013, new Bulgarian Foreign Affairs Minister Kristian Vigenin stated that: "There is no conclusive evidence for the implication of Hezbollah in the July 2012 bombing in Burgas. The authorities continue to gather evidence." However, two weeks later a Bulgarian representative to the European Union revealed that investigators discovered new evidence that implicates Hezbollah operatives were connected to the terrorist attacks. Investigators found that the forged documents used by the perpetrators of the attack were facilitated by a man with ties to Hezbollah. In July 2013, the newly appointed Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetlin Yovchev stated: "there are clear signs that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing." On 25 July 2013, the Bulgarian Interior Ministry released photographs of two Hezbollah operatives suspected in the bombing: Australian citizen Malid Farah (also known as "Hussein Hussein"), and Canadian citizen Hassan al-Haj. In 2013, and partly in response to the bombing, the EU unanimously voted to list the military branch of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.

The battle was the first major defeat of the war for the Americans, and it came with heavy losses. General Richard Montgomery was killed, Benedict Arnold was wounded, and Daniel Morgan and more than 400 men were taken prisoner. The city's garrison, a motley assortment of regular troops and militia led by Quebec's provincial governor, General Guy Carleton, suffered a small number of casualties. Montgomery's army had captured Montreal on November 13, and early in December they became one force that was led by Arnold, whose men had made an arduous trek through the wilderness of northern New England. Governor Carleton had escaped from Montreal to Quebec, the Americans' next objective, and last-minute reinforcements arrived to bolster the city's limited defenses before the attacking force's arrival. Concerned that expiring enlistments would reduce his force, Montgomery made the end-of-year attack in a blinding snowstorm to conceal his army's movements. The plan was for separate forces led by Montgomery and Arnold to converge in the lower city before scaling the walls protecting the upper city. Montgomery's force turned back after he was killed by cannon fire early in the battle, but Arnold's force penetrated further into the lower city. Arnold was injured early in the attack, and Morgan led the assault in his place before he became trapped in the lower city and was forced to surrender. Arnold and the Americans maintained an ineffectual blockade of the city until spring, when British reinforcements arrived.\nevents: t0: December 31 , 1775, t1: November 13, t2: the end-of-year, t3: December, t4: spring, e0: Battle, e1: fought, e2: War, e3: battle, e4: defeat, e5: war, e6: came, e7: losses, e8: killed, e9: wounded, e10: taken, e11: prisoner, e12: suffered, e13: captured, e14: became, e15: made, e16: trek, e17: escaped, e18: arrived, e19: bolster, e20: attacking, e21: reduce, e22: made, e23: attack, e24: conceal, e25: converge, e26: turned, e27: killed, e28: battle, e29: penetrated, e30: injured, e31: attack, e32: assault, e33: became, e34: forced, e35: surrender, e36: blockade, e37: arrived\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

It is considered to be the world's worst industrial disaster. Over 500,000 people were exposed to methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas. The highly toxic substance made its way into and around the small towns located near the plant. Estimates vary on the death toll. The official immediate death toll was 2,259. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries. Others estimate that 8,000 died within two weeks, and another 8,000 or more have since died from gas-related diseases. The cause of the disaster remains under debate. The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) argues water entered the tank through an act of sabotage. The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million (equivalent to $ in ) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to Eveready Industries India Limited (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster. Civil and criminal cases filed in the United States against UCC and Warren Anderson, UCC CEO at the time of the disaster, were dismissed and redirected to Indian courts on multiple occasions between 1986 and 2012, as the US courts focused on UCIL being a standalone entity of India. Civil and criminal cases were also filed in the District Court of Bhopal, India, involving UCC, UCIL and UCC CEO Anderson. In June 2010, seven Indian nationals who were UCIL employees in 1984, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by Indian law. All were released on bail shortly after the verdict. An eighth former employee was also convicted, but died before the judgement was passed.\nevents: t0: the night of 2–3 December 1984, t1: 2006, t2: 1989, t3: 1994, t4: 1998, t5: 2001, t6: 1986, t7: 2012, t8: June 2010, t9: 1984, e0: disaster, e1: referred, e2: considered, e3: disaster, e4: exposed, e5: death, e6: death, e7: confirmed, e8: deaths, e9: stated, e10: caused, e11: injuries, e12: injuries, e13: disabling, e14: injuries, e15: estimate, e16: died, e17: died, e18: diseases, e19: disaster, e20: remains, e21: debate, e22: argue, e23: deferred, e24: created, e25: caused, e26: triggering, e27: disaster, e28: argues, e29: entered, e30: holding, e31: paid, e32: settle, e33: stemming, e34: disaster, e35: sold, e36: merged, e37: ended, e38: terminated, e39: lease, e40: turned, e41: purchased, e42: disaster, e43: filed, e44: focused, e45: filed, e46: involving, e47: convicted, e48: causing, e49: death, e50: sentenced, e51: allowed, e52: released, e53: convicted, e54: died, e55: passed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The events take place simultaneously on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend, sharing the same bill. The Reading Festival is held at Little John\'s Farm on Richfield Avenue in central Reading, near the Caversham Bridge The Leeds event is held in Bramham Park, near Wetherby, the grounds of a historic house Campsites are available at both sites and weekend tickets include camping. Day tickets are also sold. The Reading Festival, the older of the two festivals, is the world\'s oldest popular music festival still in existence. Many of the UK\'s most successful rock and pop bands have played at the festival, including The Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, The Kinks, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, The Who, Cream, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Genesis, Iron Maiden, The Jam, The Police, Status Quo, The Pogues, Blur, Pulp, Muse, The Cure, Radiohead, The Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, Biffy Clyro and Oasis.

The festival has had various musical phases over the years, but since the current two-site format was adopted in 1999, rock, alternative, indie, punk and metal have been the main genres featured in the line-up. The festivals are run by Festival Republic, which was divested from Mean Fiddler Music Group. From 1998–2007 the festivals were known as the "Carling Weekend: Reading" and the "Carling Weekend: Leeds" for promotional purposes. In November 2007 the sponsored title was abolished after nine years and the Reading Festival reclaimed its original name.

Fought by the Parliamentarians, commanded by Sydnam Poyntz, and the Royalists under the personal command of King Charles I, it was a significant defeat for the Royalists, with heavy losses and Charles prevented from relieving the Siege of Chester. Prior to the battle, Charles had been attempting to link up with the Marquess of Montrose in Scotland following the Royalist defeat in the Battle of Naseby. Although his attempts to do so were unsuccessful, they were disruptive enough that the Committee of Both Kingdoms ordered Sydnam Poyntz to pursue the King with approximately 3,000 horse. After Charles was informed that Chester, his only remaining port, was under siege, he marched there with the intent of relieving the defenders, ordering 3,000 horse under the command of Marmaduke Langdale to camp outside the city while he and 600 others travelled into Chester itself on 23 September 1645. The intent was to attack the besieging Parliamentarians from both sides, Charles mistakenly believing that Poyntz had failed to follow them. In fact he was barely behind, and moved to attack Langdale's force in the early hours of 24 September. Although Langdale drove Poyntz off, the Parliamentarians besieging Chester sent reinforcements, and Langdale was forced to retreat to Rowton Heath, closer to Chester, and wait for his own reinforcements. This force, under Charles Gerard and Lord Bernard Stewart, was prevented from joining them, and Langdale was instead attacked by both Poyntz's force and the reinforcement. After being driven off the field and failing in an attempt to regroup at Chester itself, the Royalists retreated as dusk fell. Royalist casualties were high, with 600 killed, including Stewart, and 900 taken prisoner. This defeat prevented Charles from relieving the defenders in Chester, which fell to the Parliamentarians on 3 February 1646. Charles instead withdrew with approximately 2,400 remaining cavalry, most of whom were destroyed by Poyntz's ambush at Sherburn-in-Elmet on 15 October 1645.\nevents: t0: 24 September 1645, t1: 23 September 1645, t2: 3 February 1646, t3: 15 October 1645, t4: 24 September, t5: the English Civil War, e0: Battle, e1: Battle, e2: occurred, e3: War, e4: Fought, e5: commanded, e6: command, e7: defeat, e8: losses, e9: prevented, e10: relieving, e11: Siege, e12: battle, e13: link, e14: defeat, e15: Battle, e16: disruptive, e17: ordered, e18: informed, e19: siege, e20: marched, e21: relieving, e22: ordering, e23: command, e24: travelled, e25: attack, e26: believing, e27: follow, e28: moved, e29: attack, e30: drove, e31: sent, e32: forced, e33: retreat, e34: prevented, e35: joining, e36: attacked, e37: driven, e38: regroup, e39: retreated, e40: casualties, e41: killed, e42: taken, e43: defeat, e44: prevented, e45: relieving, e46: withdrew, e47: destroyed, e48: ambush\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

However, due to the end of the war in the Pacific, it was never fully executed. Some of the proposed landings on Penang went ahead as planned to probe Japanese intentions, encountering no resistance. The planned deception for this attack was called Operation Slippery, whilst a small Special Operations Executive team led by Tun Ibrahim Ismail which landed in October 1944 managed to convince the Japanese that the landings were to be on the Isthmus of Kra, to the north. Operations Jurist and Tiderace were put into action following the surrender of Japan, with the objectives of directly liberating Penang and Singapore respectively, followed by smaller amphibious landings on the coast of Selangor and Negeri Sembilan.

It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 7 November (25 October, O.S.) 1917. It followed and capitalized on the February Revolution of the same year, which overthrew the Tsarist autocracy and resulted in a provisional government after a transfer of power proclaimed by Grand Duke Michael, the younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II, who declined to take power after the Tsar stepped down. During this time, urban workers began to organize into councils (soviets) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. After the Congress of Soviets, the newly governing body, had its second session it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other left-wing groups such as the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to important positions within the new state of affairs. This immediately initiated the establishment of the Russian Soviet Republic. On 17 July 1918, the Tsar and his family were executed. The revolution was led by the Bolsheviks, who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military Revolutionary Committee began the occupation of government buildings on 7 November 1917 (New Style). The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured. The slogan of the October revolution was All Power to the Soviets, meaning all power to grassroots democratically elected councils. For a time, this was observed, with the interim Bolshevik-only Sovnarkom or Soviet government replaced by a Bolshevik-Left SR coalition government with an All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets composed of all representatives of all factions who supported Soviet power and legally entrenching the peasant land seizures. Throughout 1918, from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which resulted in a Left SR walkout, and other policies disputed by both the other pro-soviet parties and minority factions of the Bolsheviks, this progressively dissipated until by 1920 there were no free elections but delegates appointed by a party state. The long-awaited Constituent Assembly elections were held on 12 November 1917. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which won 370 seats, although the SR Party no longer existed as a whole party by that time, as the Left SRs had gone into coalition with the Bolsheviks from October 1917 to March 1918 (a cause of dispute of the legitimacy of the returned seating of the Constituent Assembly, as the old lists were drawn up by the old SR Party leadership, and thus represented mostly Right SRs, whereas the peasant soviet deputies had returned majorities for the pro-Bolshevik Left SRs). The Constituent Assembly was to first meet on 28 November 1917, but its convocation was delayed until 5 January 1918 by the Bolsheviks. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved the next day by order of the Congress of Soviets. As the revolution was not universally recognized, there followed the struggles of the Russian Civil War (1917–22) and the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922.\nevents: t0: 7 November, t1: 1917, t2: the same year, t3: 17 july 1918, t4: 7 November 1917, t5: The following day, t6: 1918, t7: 1920, t8: 12 november 1917, t9: october 1917, t10: march 1918, t11: 28 november 1917, t12: 5 january 1918, t13: 1917–22, t14: 1922, t15: the next day, t16: this time, t17: that time, e0: known, e1: revolution, e2: revolution, e3: took place, e4: revolution, e5: overthrew, e6: resulted in, e7: transfer, e8: proclaimed, e9: declined, e10: began, e11: organize, e12: criticized, e13: elected, e14: initiated, e15: executed, e16: used, e17: organize, e18: began, e19: captured, e20: elected, e21: observed, e22: replaced, e23: composed, e24: supported, e25: entrenching, e26: resulted in, e27: disputed, e28: dissipated, e29: elections, e30: appointed, e31: elections, e32: coming, e33: existed, e34: gone, e35: returned, e36: meet, e37: delayed, e38: came, e39: rejected, e40: resulting in, e41: recognized, e42: struggles\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

HMS "Gaspee" was a British customs schooner that had been enforcing the Navigation Acts in and around Newport, Rhode Island in 1772. It ran aground in shallow water while chasing the packet ship "Hannah" on June 9 near Gaspee Point in Warwick, Rhode Island. A group of men led by Abraham Whipple and John Brown attacked, boarded, and torched the ship. The event increased hostilities between the American colonists and British officials, following the Boston Massacre in 1770. British officials in Rhode Island wanted to increase their control over trade—legitimate trade as well as smuggling—in order to increase their revenue from the small colony. But Rhode Islanders increasingly protested the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, and other British impositions that had clashed with the colony\'s history of rum manufacturing, maritime trade, and slave trading. This event and others in Narragansett Bay marked the first acts of violent uprising against the British crown\'s authority in America, preceding the Boston Tea Party by more than a year and moving the Thirteen Colonies as a whole toward the war for independence.\nevents: t0: 1772, t1: June 9, t2: 1770, e0: affair, e1: enforcing, e2: ran, e3: chasing, e4: attacked, e5: boarded, e6: torched, e7: increased, e8: increase, e9: control, e10: protested, e11: clashed, e12: marked, e13: uprising, e14: preceding, e15: moving\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It originated in 1948 as an ethnic and religious separatist insurgency in the historical Malay Patani Region, made up of the three southernmost provinces of Thailand and parts of a fourth, but has become more complex and increasingly violent since 2001. The former Sultanate of Pattani, which included the southern Thai provinces of Pattani (Patani), Yala (Jala), Narathiwat (Menara)—also known as the three Southern Border Provinces (SBP)—as well as neighbouring parts of Songkhla Province (Singgora), and the northeastern part of Malaysia (Kelantan), was conquered by the Kingdom of Siam in 1785 and, except for Kelantan, has been governed by Thailand ever since. Although low-level separatist violence had occurred in the region for decades, the campaign escalated after 2001, with a recrudescence in 2004, and has occasionally spilled over into other provinces. Incidents blamed on southern insurgents have occurred in Bangkok and Phuket. In July 2005, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra assumed wide-ranging emergency powers to deal with the southern violence, but the insurgency escalated further. On 19 September 2006, a military junta ousted Thaksin Shinawatra in a coup. The junta implemented a major policy shift by replacing Thaksin\'s earlier approach with a campaign to win over the "hearts and minds" of the insurgents. Despite little progress in curbing the violence, the junta declared that security was improving and that peace would come to the region by 2008. By March 2008, however, the death toll surpassed 3,000. During the Democrat-led government of Abhisit Vejjajiva, Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya noted a "sense of optimism" and said that he was confident of bringing peace to the region in 2010. But by the end of 2010 insurgency-related violence had increased, confounding the government\'s optimism. Finally in March 2011, the government conceded that violence was increasing and could not be solved in a few months. Local leaders have persistently demanded at least a level of autonomy from Thailand for the Patani region and some of the separatist insurgent movements have made a series of demands for peace talks and negotiations. However, these groups have been largely sidelined by the Barisan Revolusi Nasional-Koordinasi (BRN-C), the group currently spearheading the insurgency. It sees no reason for negotiations and is against talks with other insurgent groups. The BRN-C has as its immediate aim to make southern Thailand ungovernable and it has largely been successful. Estimates of the strength of the insurgency vary greatly. In 2004 General Pallop Pinmanee claimed that there were only 500 hardcore jihadists. Other estimates say there as many as 15,000 armed insurgents. Around 2004 some Thai analysts believed that foreign Islamic terrorist groups were infiltrating the area, and that foreign funds and arms are being brought in, though again, such claims were balanced by an equally large body of opinion suggesting this remains a distinctly local conflict. Over 6,500 people died and almost 12,000 were injured between 2004 and 2015 in a formerly ethnic separatist insurgency, which has currently been taken over by hard-line jihadis and pitted them against both the Thai-speaking Buddhist minority and local Muslims who have a moderate approach or who support the Thai government.\nevents: t0: 1948, t1: 2001, t2: 2001, t3: 2004, t4: 19 September 2006, t5: 2008, t6: March 2008, t7: March 2011, t8: 2004, t9: 2004, t10: 2004, t11: 2015, t12: a few months, t13: 1785, t14: July 2005, t15: 2010, e0: conflict, e1: originated, e2: become, e3: conquered, e4: governed, e5: violence, e6: occurred, e7: escalated, e8: spilled, e9: blamed, e10: occurred, e11: violence, e12: ousted, e13: implemented, e14: replacing, e15: approach, e16: violence, e17: declared, e18: improving, e19: come to, e20: surpassed, e21: noted, e22: bringing, e23: violence, e24: increased, e25: conceded, e26: violence, e27: increasing, e28: solved, e29: demanded, e30: demands, e31: negotiations, e32: negotiations, e33: talks, e34: claimed, e35: estimates, e36: believed, e37: brought in, e38: claims, e39: balanced, e40: suggesting, e41: died, e42: injured, e43: taken over, e44: approach, e45: support\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It was the 87th edition of the Australian Open and was held from 18 through 31 January 1999. This was the first Grand Slam of the calendar year. Total attendance for the event reached 391,504. In the singles competition, Petr Korda and Martina Hingis were the defending champions. Korda was unseeded at this tournament and was eliminated in the third round by American 15th seed Todd Martin. This loss resulted in him falling down the rankings from 20th to 76th. Later in July, Korda received a suspension from tennis by the ITF after testing positive for nandrolone at Wimbledon last year. Yevgeny Kafelnikov, on the other hand, ended up becoming the men's champion, defeating surprise finalist Swede Thomas Enqvist in four sets. With this win, Kafelnikov became the first Russian, male or female, to win an Australian Open title. In the women's singles, two-time defending champion Martina Hingis successfully defended her title, defeating another surprise finalist in Frenchwoman Amélie Mauresmo. This win allowed Hingis to join Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles as the only women to have won three consecutive Australian Open titles. Amélie Mauresmo would later become the World No. 1 in 2004, and despite being one of the top players of the early to mid-2000s, this would be her only Grand Slam final until the 2006 Australian Open, which she won. In doubles, the defending champions were Jonas Björkman and Jacco Eltingh for the men's, Martina Hingis and Mirjana Lučić for the women's, and Venus Williams and Justin Gimelstob for the mixed. Eltingh did not participate at this year's Australian Open, leaving Björkman to team up with Australia's Patrick Rafter. Rafter and Björkman later won the title, defeating the Indian first seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in five sets. Hingis and Lučić also separated, with Hingis teaming up with Anna Kournikova and Lučić teaming up with Mary Pierce. Lučić and Pierce fell in the first round, but Hingis and Kournikova went on to win, by defeating first seeds Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva at the final. The mixed doubles competition saw Williams and Gimelstob not competing, and none of the seeds reaching past the second round. In the end, the South African team of Mariaan de Swardt and David Adams won, defeating Williams' sister Serena and her partner Max Mirnyi in the final. The Juniors Competition saw the first ever junior double, with Kristian Pless and Virginie Razzano both winning their respective singles and doubles titles. Pless defeated Mikhail Youzhny in the singles before teaming up with Jürgen Melzer to defeat the Czech team of Ladislav Chramosta and Michal Navrátil in the doubles. Razzano defeated Katarína Bašternáková in the singles final and teamed up Eleni Daniilidou to defeat South Africans Natalie Grandin and Nicole Rencken in straight sets. The last time a boy won both the singles and doubles title at a Grand Slam was Roger Federer at the previous year's Wimbledon, while the last girl was Cara Black at the Wimbledon the year before. Julien Jeanpierre and Mirjana Lučić were the last players to win Australian Open Junior singles and doubles titles in the same year; in 1998 and 1997 respectively.\nevents: t0: 18, t1: 31 January 1999, t2: last year, t3: 2006, t4: 2004, t5: 1998, t6: 1997, t7: mid-2000s, t8: the same year, t9: the previous year, t10: 1999, t11: Later in July, e0: played, e1: held, e2: reached, e3: eliminated, e4: resulted in, e5: falling, e6: received, e7: testing, e8: ended up, e9: becoming, e10: defeating, e11: became, e12: win, e13: defended, e14: defeating, e15: allowed, e16: join, e17: become, e18: participate, e19: leaving, e20: defeating, e21: separated, e22: teaming up, e23: teaming up, e24: fell, e25: win, e26: defeating, e27: competing, e28: defeating, e29: winning, e30: defeated, e31: teaming up, e32: defeat, e33: defeated, e34: teamed up, e35: defeat, e36: win\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Forming on July 23 from a tropical wave, the storm rapidly intensified from a tropical depression into a Category 5 hurricane in two days, and lasted for only six hours at that intensity before weakening. It was one of only sixteen known hurricanes in the East Pacific east of the International Date Line to have reached such an intensity. Although heavy waves were able to reach the Mexican coastline, no damages or casualties were reported in relation to the hurricane. The hurricane moved westward due to a high pressure ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: the first was around peak intensity and was completed when the hurricane moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after the hurricane began to weaken. The last advisory was issued while the hurricane was west of Mexico, but it was not until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated. Elida's rapid intensification and unsteady weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in the intensity forecasting of the hurricane. Although the intensity forecasts were off, the track forecasts were better than usual compared to the ten-year period prior to that year.\nevents: t0: 2002, t1: July 23, t2: two days, t3: six hours, t4: ten-year, t5: that year, e0: hurricane, e1: Forming, e2: intensified, e3: known, e4: hurricanes, e5: reached, e6: reach, e7: damages, e8: casualties, e9: reported, e10: hurricane, e11: moved, e12: moved, e13: began, e14: weaken, e15: issued, e16: dissipated, e17: weakening, e18: reaching, e19: caused, e20: hurricane\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The operation was preceded by the better known rescue of and French soldiers from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo On 20 May, the Germans had captured Abbeville at the mouth of the Somme and cut off the main Allied armies in the north. South of the river, the Allies improvised defences and made local counter-attacks, to dislodge the Germans from bridgeheads on the south bank and re-capture river crossings for an advance northwards to regain contact with the armies in northern France and Flanders. The 1st Armoured Division arrived in France from 15 May, without artillery and short of units that had been diverted to Calais. The division joined the large number of lines-of-communication troops south of the Somme, many of whom were hurriedly organised into the Beauman Division and other improvised units, despite a lack of training and weapons. French troops were sent into the area, as Général d\'armée Maxime Weygand attempted to build up a defence in depth on the south bank of the Somme and make bigger attacks to eliminate the German bridgeheads. From about half of the German bridgehead south of Abbeville was recaptured by Franco-British troops; the Allies were reinforced by infantry divisions and the "4e" Division "cuirassée" (4e DCr, Colonel Charles De Gaulle) but lost many of their tanks and the Germans much of their infantry, some units running back over the river Somme. When "Fall Rot" (Case Red), the final German offensive, began on 5 June, the IX Corps of the French Tenth Army (including the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (Major-General Victor Fortune) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) after it arrived from the Saar on 28 May), was pushed back to the Bresle River. On 9 June, German tanks entered Rouen on the Seine, cutting off the IX Corps from the X Corps to the east and from the Seine to the south. The French and British commanders in the pocket decided to make for Le Havre and Fortune detached Arkforce, the equivalent of two brigades, to guard the routes back to the port. During the night of the remainder of the Highland Division and the French divisions of IX Corps, prepared to continue the retreat but found that the 7th "Panzer" Division ("Generalmajor" Erwin Rommel) had advanced from Rouen through Yvetot to Cany and Veulettes-sur-Mer on the Durdent river. With an Allied withdrawal to Le Havre cut off, the Highlanders and the French retreated to St Valery-en-Caux, where from and soldiers were rescued by the Navy. The remainder, including over 6,000 Highlanders, were taken prisoner on 12 June. At Le Havre, from 10 to 13 June, troops from Arkforce, other British units in the port and Allied forces were evacuated; attempts by the Franco-British to prepare a "national redoubt" in Brittany came to nothing.

The British captain, George Courtenay of HMS "Boston", had arrived off New York City on 28 May and deliberately disguised his ship as a French vessel, fooling a French officer into coming aboard and making him a prisoner of war. Courtenay then sent a message into New York, where he knew a French frigate lay at anchor, challenging the French captain to battle within the next three days. The challenge was accepted and widely disseminated throughout the city, so that when Captain Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart of "Embuscade" sailed out to meet Courtenay on the morning of 31 July, the shore was crowded with thousands of sightseers. The engagement between the ships was fiercely contested, but the smaller and more lightly armed "Boston" seemed to be taking the more serious damage when at 6:20 Captain Courtenay was thrown to the deck. What happened next has been subject to debate, with the second-in-command, Lieutenant John Edwards claiming that Courtenay had been killed and he was thrown overboard as was the custom at the time. However rumours subsequently circulated that Courtenay had only been knocked unconscious when Edwards gave the order to jettison him, a story that his family credited and was later taken up by the contemporary historian Edward Pelham Brenton, although historian William James subsequently defended Edwards\' actions. With Courtenay gone, "Boston" continued to suffer severe damage until just after 07:00, when the remaining officers ordered all surviving sails set and the British ship attempted to escape. Although Bompart pursued, by 08:00 the strain had proved too much for his ship and he fell back. After a close encounter with French ships in the Delaware River, "Boston" eventually escaped to St John\'s, Newfoundland while "Embuscade" refitted in New York.\nevents: t0: 31 July 1793, t1: 28 May, t2: 07:00, t3: 6:20, t4: 08:00, t5: 31 July, t6: three days, e0: engagement, e1: Wars, e2: arrived, e3: disguised, e4: coming, e5: making, e6: sent, e7: knew, e8: lay, e9: challenging, e10: battle, e11: challenge, e12: accepted, e13: disseminated, e14: sailed, e15: meet, e16: crowded, e17: engagement, e18: contested, e19: seemed, e20: taking, e21: damage, e22: thrown, e23: debate, e24: claiming, e25: killed, e26: circulated, e27: knocked, e28: gave, e29: jettison, e30: credited, e31: taken up, e32: defended, e33: gone, e34: continued, e35: suffer, e36: damage, e37: ordered, e38: escape, e39: proved, e40: fell, e41: encounter, e42: escaped\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Richard Haste, a New York Police Department officer, shot Graham in the bathroom of Graham\'s apartment. The officer Michael Best had been informed that Graham had a gun and believed that Graham had been reaching for a gun in his waistband after disregarding police orders and shouting expletives at police. Haste was charged with manslaughter, but the charge was dropped. Graham\'s family filed a lawsuit against the city of New York, and the lawsuit was settled for $3.9 million in 2015. The NYPD Firearms Discharge Review Board found the shooting to be within department guidelines. In 2016, under pressure from DeBlasio and prior to Bratton\'s resignation, Haste was offered to vest out with all benefits, in spite of having been cleared of all criminal charges and found within guidelines. Haste opted to go to department trial. In 2017, an internal NYPD investigation explored whether Haste used "poor tactics" leading up to the shooting.

This happened in a period of truce after the end of the Irish War of Independence (in July 1921) and before the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in June 1922. All the dead and missing were Protestants, which has led to the killings being described as sectarian. Six were killed as purported British informers and loyalists, while four others were relatives killed in the absence of the target. Three other men were kidnapped and executed in Bandon as revenge for the killing of an IRA officer Michael O\'Neill during an armed raid. One man was shot and survived his injuries. It is not clear who ordered the attacks or carried them out. However, in 2014 the "Irish Times" released a confidential memo from the then-Director of Intelligence Colonel Michael Joe Costello (later managing director of the Irish Sugar Company) in September 1925 in relation to a pension claim by former Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer Daniel O\'Neill of Enniskean, County Cork, stating: "O\'Neill is stated to be a very unscrupulous individual and to have taken part in such operations as lotting [looting] of Post Offices, robbing of Postmen and the murder of several Protestants in West Cork in May 1922. A brother of his was shot dead by two of the latter named, Woods and Hornbrooke [sic], who were subsequently murdered." Sinn Féin and IRA representatives, from both the pro-Treaty side, which controlled the Provisional Government in Dublin and the anti-Treaty side, which controlled the area the killings took place in, immediately condemned the killings. The motivation of the killers remains unclear. It is generally agreed that they were provoked by the fatal shooting of IRA man Michael O\'Neill by a loyalist whose house was being raided on 26 April. Some historians have claimed there were sectarian motives; others claim that those killed were targeted only because they were suspected of having been informers during the Anglo-Irish War, and argue that the dead were associated with the so-called "Murragh Loyalist Action Group", and that their names may have appeared in captured British military intelligence files which listed "helpful citizens" during the Anglo-Irish War (1919–1921),\nevents: t0: 26–28 April 1922, t1: July 1921, t2: June 1922, t3: 2014, t4: September 1925, t5: May 1922, t6: 26 April, t7: 1919–1921, e0: killing, e1: happened, e2: truce, e3: end, e4: War, e5: outbreak, e6: War, e7: dead, e8: led to, e9: killings, e10: described, e11: killed, e12: killed, e13: kidnapped, e14: executed, e15: revenge, e16: killing, e17: raid, e18: shot, e19: injuries, e20: ordered, e21: attacks, e22: carried, e23: released, e24: managing, e25: claim, e26: stating, e27: stated, e28: taken part, e29: operations, e30: looting, e31: robbing, e32: murder, e33: shot, e34: dead, e35: murdered, e36: controlled, e37: controlled, e38: killings, e39: took place, e40: condemned, e41: killings, e42: remains, e43: agreed, e44: provoked, e45: shooting, e46: raided, e47: claimed, e48: claim, e49: targeted, e50: suspected, e51: War, e52: argue, e53: associated, e54: listed, e55: War\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Originally the knights moved into the fortress as an ally of Poland against the Margraviate of Brandenburg. However, after disputes over the control of the city between the Order and the King of Poland arose, the knights murdered a number of citizens within the city and took it as their own. Thus the event is also known as Gdańsk massacre or Gdańsk slaughter ("rzeź Gdańska"). Though in the past, a matter of debate among historians, a consensus has been established that many people were murdered and a considerable part of the town was destroyed in the context of the take-over. In the aftermath of the take-over, the order seized all of Pomerelia (Gdańsk Pomerania) and bought up the supposed Brandenburgian claims to the region in the Treaty of Soldin (1309). The conflict with Poland was temporarily settled in the Treaty of Kalisz (1343).

Approximately 250,000-500,000 people took part in each march. Events leading up to the first march. On 3 August 1981, 12,500 air traffic controllers, members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), walked off their jobs with the Federal Aviation Administration. President Ronald Reagan vowed to fire the controllers if they did not return to work within 48 hours. On the first day of the strike 85 percent of union controllers were out. Two days later, Reagan fired the striking controllers -- 12,000 air traffic controllers were fired on August 5. PATCO was demanding wage increases, safer working conditions, a 32-hour week, and an end to long shift patterns. As federal employees they were, however, barred from striking. The FAA replaced the strikers with non-union workers. According to the union, 481 near misses among airplanes in US airspace were reported in the first year of the strike, compared to 10 reported in the 10 years before the walkout. Militants were arrested, jailed and fined. Some PATCO members with federal mortgages lost their homes. The union was fined millions of dollars, and its $3.5 million strike fund was frozen. Eventually, the government succeeded in decertifying PATCO. The president of the US union federation, the AFL-CIO, denounced Reagan's attack on PATCO. A letter was also sent to AFL-CIO affiliates, discouraging them from taking any type of strike action in solidarity. Following the firing of the PATCO workers, officials from that union visited various other unions in an attempt to garner support for the strike. These efforts were not particularly well received because in the 1980 presidential election, PATCO refused to back President Jimmy Carter, instead endorsing Republican Party candidate Ronald Reagan. PATCO's refusal to endorse the Democratic candidate stemmed in large part from poor labor relations with the FAA (the employer of PATCO members) under the Carter administration and Ronald Reagan's endorsement of the union and its struggle for better conditions during the 1980 election campaign.\nevents: t0: September 19 , 1981, t1: August 31 , 1991, t2: 3 august 1981, t3: the first day, t4: August 5, t5: 1980, t6: 1980, t7: 48 hours, t8: Two days later, e0: rallies, e1: support, e2: took place, e3: march, e4: leading, e5: march, e6: walked, e7: vowed, e8: return, e9: work, e10: strike, e11: demanding, e12: increases, e13: end, e14: striking, e15: reported, e16: strike, e17: reported, e18: arrested, e19: jailed, e20: fined, e21: lost, e22: fined, e23: strike, e24: denounced, e25: attack, e26: sent, e27: discouraging, e28: taking, e29: firing, e30: visited, e31: support, e32: strike, e33: received, e34: election, e35: refused, e36: refusal, e37: endorse, e38: struggle, e39: election\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The shooting left eight employees and tourists dead. Another eight were either shot at or wounded. The alleged perpetrators were five Virgin Islanders whom authorities initially believed to have committed the execution-style shooting in the course of a robbery gone bad. However, in court, the defense, led by civil rights activists William Kunstler and Chauncey Eskridge, argued in part that the accused were politically motivated victims of systematic race-based civil rights deprivation; all of the defendants were Afro-Caribbean men, while seven of the eight victims were white. Two of the accused, Raphael Joseph and Warren Ballentine, explained that they had only planned on committing a robbery, and that things got out of hand because one of the co-defendants, Ishmael LaBeet, was adamant that they also make "a political statement" because "he was angry about foreigners coming in to take our money and leaving us with nothing." According to Joseph, LaBeet, during the commission of the robbery, suddenly began shooting people while yelling epithets like, "I hate you white motherfuckers!" LaBeet, who escaped from custody and fled to Cuba in 1984, has denied this version of events, as well as any involvement at all in the shooting. All five men were convicted of multiple charges of murder, assault, and robbery, and each was sentenced to eight consecutive life sentences in federal detention. The public\'s perception of a racially tinged motivation for the killings and fear of further violence led to a steep decline in tourism to St. Croix, from which the island\'s tourism industry did not begin to recover until decades later. On 31 December 1984, one of the convicted men, Ishmael LaBeet, hijacked American Airlines Flight 626 while in United States federal custody on a transfer to new detention. The flight was forced to land in Cuba, where LaBeet escaped. He was never recaptured by the United States and, with the thawing of Cuban–American relations in 2015, was confirmed to be living at large in Cuba following an indeterminate amount of time spent in a Cuban prison. Three of the five men remain in prison; another is deceased. LaBeet was the subject of the 2016 documentary film "The Skyjacker\'s Tale".\nevents: t0: 1984, t1: 31 December 1984, t2: 2015, t3: 2016, t4: the afternoon of 6 September 1972, e0: shooting, e1: occurred, e2: shooting, e3: left, e4: dead, e5: shot, e6: wounded, e7: believed, e8: shooting, e9: defense, e10: argued, e11: explained, e12: planned, e13: robbery, e14: statement, e15: angry, e16: coming, e17: take, e18: leaving, e19: robbery, e20: began, e21: shooting, e22: yelling, e23: escaped, e24: fled, e25: denied, e26: involvement, e27: shooting, e28: convicted, e29: murder, e30: robbery, e31: sentenced, e32: killings, e33: violence, e34: led to, e35: decline, e36: begin, e37: recover, e38: convicted, e39: hijacked, e40: transfer, e41: land, e42: escaped, e43: recaptured, e44: confirmed, e45: spent, e46: deceased\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Algiers had been a province of the Ottoman Empire since the Capture of Algiers in 1529 by Hayreddin Barbarossa. A diplomatic incident in 1827, the so-called Fan Affair (Fly Whisk Incident) served as a pretext to initiate a blockade against the port of Algiers. After three years of standstill and a more severe incident in which a French ship carrying an ambassador to the dey with a proposal for negotiations was bombarded, the French determined that more forceful action was required. Charles X was also in need of diverting attention from turbulent French domestic affairs that culminated with his deposition during the later stages of the invasion in the July Revolution. The invasion of Algiers began on 5 July 1830 with a naval bombardment by a fleet under Admiral Duperré, and a landing by troops under Louis Auguste Victor de Ghaisne, comte de Bourmont. The French quickly defeated the troops of Hussein Dey, the Ottoman ruler, but native resistance was widespread. This resulted in a protracted military campaign, lasting more than 45 years, to root out popular opposition to the colonisation. The so-called "pacification" was marked by resistance of figures such as Ahmed Bey, Abd El-Kader and Lalla Fatma N\'Soumer. The invasion marked the end of several centuries of Ottoman rule in Algeria and the beginning of French Algeria. In 1848, the territories conquered around Algiers were organised into three départements, defining the territories of modern Algeria.\nevents: t0: 1830, t1: 1529, t2: 1827, t3: july, t4: 5 July 1830, t5: more than 45 years, t6: 1848, e0: Invasion, e1: operation, e2: ruled, e3: invaded, e4: conquered, e5: initiate, e6: bombarded, e7: determined, e8: required, e9: culminated, e10: began, e11: defeated, e12: resulted in, e13: root, e14: marked, e15: marked, e16: conquered, e17: organised\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The conference included the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 5th Meeting of the Parties (MOP 5) to the Kyoto Protocol. According to the Bali Road Map, a framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012 was to be agreed there. On Friday 18 December, the final day of the conference, international media reported that the climate talks were "in disarray". Media also reported that in lieu of a summit collapse, only a "weak political statement" was anticipated at the conclusion of the conference. The Copenhagen Accord was drafted by the United States, China, India, Brazil and South Africa on 18 December, and judged a "meaningful agreement" by the United States government. It was "taken note of", but not "adopted", in a debate of all the participating countries the next day, and it was not passed unanimously. The document recognised that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the present day and that actions should be taken to keep any temperature increases to below 2 °C.

The match was played to determine the premiers for the 1898 VFL season. Fitzroy won the match by 15 points. The game was played under atrocious ground conditions, in front of 16,538 people, at the St Kilda Cricket Ground. The match is recognised as the first VFL Grand Final, although the term "Grand Final" was not in wide use until 1931. It was the first time that Victorian Football League premiership was decided in a final match, after the 1897 premiership was won under a different finals system by Essendon, when they finished above three other clubs in the finals series ladder.

The G8, meeting for the first time in 1997, was formed with the addition of Russia. In addition, the President of the European Commission has been formally included in summits since 1981. The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France's President Giscard d'Estaing and Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the initial summit of the Group of Six (G6) in 1975.\nevents: t0: May 15–17 , 1998, t1: 1976, t2: 1997, t3: 1975, t4: 1981, e0: Summit, e1: held, e2: summit, e3: meeting, e4: brought together, e5: starting, e6: meeting, e7: formed, e8: summits, e9: summits, e10: linked, e11: rebellion, e12: meetings, e13: conceived, e14: summit\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The then ruling party, Indian National Congress had been in active complicity with the mob, as to the organisation of the riots. Independent sources estimate the number of deaths at about 8,000–17,000 whilst government estimates project that about 2,800 Sikhs were killed in Delhi and 3,350 nationwide. Violence continued in the early 1980s due to the armed Sikh separatist Khalistan movement which sought independence from India. In July 1982, the Sikh political party Akali Dal\'s President Harchand Singh Longowal had invited Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to take up residence in Golden Temple Complex to evade arrest. Bhindranwale later on made the sacred temple complex an armoury and headquarters. In the violent events leading up to the Operation Blue Star since the inception of Akali Dharm Yudh Morcha, the militants had killed 165 Hindus and Nirankaris, even 39 Sikhs opposed to Bhindranwale were killed. The total number of deaths was 410 in violent incidents and riots while 1,180 people were injured. Operation Blue Star was an Indian military operation carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984, ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed militants from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex in Amritsar, Punjab. Bhindranwale died and militants were removed from the temple complex. The military action in the temple complex was criticized by Sikhs worldwide who had interpreted it as an assault on Sikh religion. Four months after the operation, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in vengeance by her two Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh. Public outcry over Gandhi\'s death led to the killings of Sikhs in the ensuing riots. In the aftermath of the riots, the government reported that 20,000 had fled the city; the People\'s Union for Civil Liberties reported "at least" 1,000 displaced persons. The most-affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods of Delhi. Human rights organisations and newspapers across India believed that the massacre was organised. The collusion of political officials in the violence and judicial failure to penalise the perpetrators alienated Sikhs and increased support for the Khalistan movement.<ref name="Watch/Asia(US)1994"></ref> The Akal Takht, Sikhism\'s governing body, considers the killings genocide. In 2011, Human Rights Watch reported that the Government of India had "yet to prosecute those responsible for the mass killings". According to the 2011 WikiLeaks cable leaks, the United States was convinced of Indian National Congress\' complicity in the riots and called it "opportunism" and "hatred" by the Congress government, of Sikhs. Although the U.S. has not identified the riots as genocide, it acknowledged that "grave human rights violations" occurred. In 2011, a new group of mass graves was discovered in Haryana and Human Rights Watch reported that "widespread anti-Sikh attacks in Haryana were part of broader revenge attacks" in India.

The victory made Ajax only the second team – after Torino's city rivals Juventus – to have won all three major European trophies (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the Cup Winners' Cup). Although this was the second season since the ban on English clubs in European competitions was lifted, only one English club was entered into the 1991–92 UEFA Cup. Liverpool, who had been forced to serve an extra year over all other English clubs as they had been the team present at the Heysel disaster which had sparked the ban in 1985, was England's representatives in the competition, and ultimately reached the quarter-finals.

Usually referred to as Festival di Sanremo, or outside Italy as Sanremo Music Festival or Sanremo Music Festival Award, it was the inspiration for the Eurovision Song Contest. It is the music equivalent to the "Premio Regia Televisiva" for television, the "Premio Ubu" for stage performances, and the Premio David di Donatello for motion pictures, but with a longer history and contest associated with. The first edition of the Sanremo Music Festival, held between 29 and 31 January 1951, was broadcast by RAI\'s radio station Rete Rossa and its only three participants were Nilla Pizzi, Achille Togliani and Duo Fasano. Starting from 1955 all the editions of the Festival have been broadcast live by the Italian TV station Rai 1. From 1951 to 1976, the Festival took place in the Sanremo Casino, but starting from 1977, all the following editions were held in the Teatro Ariston, except 1990\'s one, held at the Nuovo Mercato dei Fiori. Between 1953 and 1971, except in 1956, each song was sung twice by two different artists, each one using an individual orchestral arrangement, to illustrate the meaning of the festival as a composers\' competition, not a singers\' competition. During this era of the festival, it was custom that one version of the song was performed by a native Italian artist while the other version was performed by an international guest artist., and that was the way for many international artists to debut with hits in Italian market in those years, such a case for Louis Armstrong, Stevie Wonder, Jose Feliciano, Roberto Carlos, Paul Anka, Yardbirds, Marianne Faithfull, Shirley Bassey, Mungo Jerry and many others. The festival is used as the way of choosing the Italian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest and it has launched the careers of some of Italy\'s most successful singers, including Andrea Bocelli, Paola e Chiara, Il Volo, Giorgia, Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, and Gigliola Cinquetti.\nevents: t0: 29, t1: 31 January 1951, t2: 1955, t3: 1951, t4: 1976, t5: 1977, t6: 1990, t7: 1953, t8: 1971, t9: 1956, e0: Festival, e1: contest, e2: awards, e3: held, e4: referred, e5: held, e6: broadcast, e7: Starting, e8: broadcast, e9: took place, e10: starting, e11: held, e12: held, e13: sung, e14: using, e15: illustrate, e16: performed, e17: performed, e18: debut, e19: choosing, e20: launched\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Liverpool won the match, scoring four goals to Newcastle\'s three. The winning goal was scored by striker Stan Collymore in the second minute of stoppage time. Before the match, both clubs had lost their previous fixtures but still had a chance of winning the league and wanted to close the gap between themselves and leaders Manchester United. Newcastle United, who had been 10 points ahead at Christmas, had suffered a decline during the previous two months, winning one match out of four in March 1996, and surrendering their lead of the league to Manchester United after spending virtually all of the season top of the table. Liverpool had won six of their last nine league games during February and March, scored the most goals and conceded the fewest until this match. Liverpool started the match as the more promising team and striker Robbie Fowler scored the first goal. Newcastle striker Les Ferdinand scored the equaliser in the tenth minute and winger David Ginola added a second for Newcastle four minutes later. Fowler scored early in the second half to equalise but Faustino Asprilla restored their goal advantage in the 57th minute. Stan Collymore, who set up the opening goal for Liverpool, equalised for Liverpool in the 68th minute. In stoppage time, Collymore scored his second goal of the match involving a one-two with Ian Rush and John Barnes in the buildup. The winner sparked jubilant scenes for Liverpool supporters at Anfield and consigned Newcastle to their second consecutive defeat in the league, reducing their chances of winning the league, although ultimately Manchester United were not confirmed as champions until the final game of the season. The match is considered to be among the best Premier League games in the history of the competition. Newcastle\'s manager Kevin Keegan described it as a "classic", while Liverpool manager Roy Evans said "the entertainment value was up there with the best". In 2003, the game was awarded the Match of the Decade award on behalf of the Premier League, which was celebrating its tenth anniversary. The result played a major factor in the outcome the league title race, as Manchester United lost only one more match that season and regained the title from Blackburn Rovers.\nevents: t0: 3 April 1996, t1: March 1996, t2: 2003, t3: February, t4: March, t5: the second minute, t6: the tenth minute, t7: a second, t8: the 57th minute, t9: the 68th minute, e0: match, e1: scoring, e2: winning, e3: scored, e4: match, e5: lost, e6: winning, e7: suffered, e8: surrendering, e9: spending, e10: scored, e11: conceded, e12: started, e13: scored, e14: scored, e15: added, e16: scored, e17: restored, e18: set up, e19: scored, e20: sparked, e21: defeat, e22: reducing, e23: winning, e24: confirmed, e25: competition, e26: described, e27: said, e28: awarded, e29: celebrating, e30: played, e31: race, e32: lost, e33: match, e34: regained\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

CMLL did not hold any special events on Fridays that would force a cancellation such as a pay-per-view (PPV). Some of the matches from Super Viernes were taped for CMLL\'s weekly shows that air in Mexico and the United States in the weeks following the Super Viernes show. Super Viernes often features storyline feud between two wrestlers or group of wrestlers that develop from week to week, often coming to a conclusion at a major CMLL event or in a match on Friday nights between the individuals. In total Super Viernes featured 46 matches with 82 wrestlers appearing in matches during April. This included six women and seven "Mini-Estrellas". CMLL only held one match featuring the women\'s division, two featuring the "Mini-Etrellas" and five "Lightning" matches. Místico was only wrestler to appear on all five Super Vierens shows in April. After being a "rúdo" since late January, 2010 April saw a change of heart by Místico. After losing a match he simply announced that he was tired of being a "rúdo" and was returning to the "técnico" (good guy) side from now on. During his appearance as a "técnico" Místico used "rúdo" tactics to win the match which cast doubts on where his allegiance truly lay. In subsequent weeks Místico appeared working more and more as a "técnico" again, although his feud with Volador Jr. flared up again during that period of time, just not on "Super Viernes". After building the feud since later January, 2010 the storyline between "Mini-Estrellas" Bracito de Oro and Pequeño Black Warrior reached its crescendo on April 30, 2010 where Pequeño Black Warrior defeated Bracito de Oro, two falls to one, in a "Lucha de Apuestas", mask vs. mask match, forcing Bracito de Oro to unmask after the match. In another development Héctor Garza appeared to be turning on his team mates El Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara (who jointly held the CMLL World Trios Championship). During one show he walked out on his partners after a misunderstanding, later on he teamed up with a "rúdo" for the "Gran Alternativa". His actions were followed by insincere claims of still being a "técnico". April also saw host to the 2010 "Torneo Gran Alternativa" ("Great Alternative tournament"). Unlike previous tournaments this year\'s "Gran Alternativa" was split out over three days and featured 16 teams instead of the usual 8 teams. On April 16, 2010 the team of Héctor Garza and Pólvora defeated Diamante and La Sombra to qualify for the final match. On April 23, Delta and Volador Jr. defeated Puma King and Último Guerrero to become the second team to qualify for the finals. On April 30, 2010 Pólvora and Héctor Garza won the 2010 "Gran Alternativa".\nevents: t0: Fridays, t1: Friday nights, t2: April, t3: April, t4: late January , 2010 April, t5: later January , 2010, t6: April 30 , 2010, t7: April 30 , 2010, t8: April 23, t9: April 16 , 2010, t10: April, t11: April 2010, t12: 2010, t13: this year \'s, t14: 2010, t15: week, t16: week, t17: subsequent weeks, e0: held, e1: shows, e2: took place, e3: hold, e4: force, e5: cancellation, e6: matches, e7: shows, e8: show, e9: feud, e10: conclusion, e11: match, e12: matches, e13: appearing, e14: matches, e15: included, e16: held, e17: match, e18: featuring, e19: featuring, e20: matches, e21: appear, e22: shows, e23: saw, e24: change, e25: losing, e26: match, e27: announced, e28: returning, e29: appearance, e30: used, e31: win, e32: match, e33: doubts, e34: appeared, e35: feud, e36: flared, e37: building, e38: feud, e39: reached, e40: defeated, e41: match, e42: forcing, e43: match, e44: development, e45: appeared, e46: turning on, e47: held, e48: show, e49: walked, e50: teamed up, e51: claims, e52: saw, e53: host, e54: tournament, e55: tournaments, e56: split, e57: defeated, e58: qualify, e59: final, e60: match, e61: defeated, e62: become, e63: qualify\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The third tropical cyclone, second named storm, and first hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Bertha developed from a frontal low pressure area offshore of North Carolina on July 24. Initially subtropical, it slowly acquired tropical characteristics while tracked southeast and then southwestward. By early on July 27, the cyclone was re-classified as a tropical depression. Following its transition, the depression intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bertha on July 28. The storm then curved northeastward and rapidly strengthened. Bertha became a hurricane early on July 29, though it weakened back to a tropical storm later that day. On the following day, Bertha re-intensified into a hurricane and peaked as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane on July 31. Early on August 2, Bertha made landfall near Sydney, Nova Scotia while weakening and transitioning back into an extratropical cyclone. Large waves impacted the East Coast of the United States; waves were reported along the coast of North Carolina. In Florida, rough seas caused two fatalities by drowning, as well as at least 200 lifeguard rescues. Seven other drowning deaths occurred offshore when the "S.S. Corazon" sank near Cape Cod. Minimal impact occurred on Bermuda, limited to mainly tropical storm force wind gusts. In Canada, strong winds caused moderate crop damage on Prince Edward Island and collapsed a suspension bridge in Nova Scotia. Rainfall caused minor flooding in the region. Overall, Bertha caused nine fatalities and approximately $3.91 million (1990 USD) in damage.\nevents: t0: 1990, t1: July 24, t2: July 27, t3: july 28, t4: July 29, t5: the following day, t6: July 31, t7: August 2, t8: 1990, t9: July and August 1990, e0: Hurricane, e1: caused, e2: damage, e3: cyclone, e4: named, e5: storm, e6: hurricane, e7: developed, e8: acquired, e9: tracked, e10: cyclone, e11: re-classified, e12: transition, e13: intensified, e14: upgraded, e15: storm, e16: storm, e17: curved, e18: strengthened, e19: became, e20: hurricane, e21: weakened, e22: storm, e23: re-intensified, e24: hurricane, e25: hurricane, e26: made, e27: weakening, e28: transitioning, e29: cyclone, e30: impacted, e31: reported, e32: caused, e33: fatalities, e34: drowning, e35: rescues, e36: drowning, e37: deaths, e38: occurred, e39: impact, e40: occurred, e41: limited, e42: storm, e43: caused, e44: damage, e45: collapsed, e46: caused, e47: flooding, e48: caused, e49: fatalities, e50: damage\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It was planned and conducted by a group of pro-Western Serb-nationalist Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force officers formally led by its commander, General Dušan Simović, who had been associated with several putsch plots from 1938 onwards. Brigadier General of Military Aviation Borivoje Mirković, Major Živan Knežević of the Yugoslav Royal Guards, and his brother Radoje Knežević were key organisers in the overthrow of the government. In addition to Radoje Knežević, some other civilian leaders were probably aware of the takeover before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia played no part in the coup, although it made a significant contribution to the mass street protests in many cities that signalled popular support for it once it had occurred. The putsch was successful and deposed the three-member regency: Prince Paul, Radenko Stanković and Ivo Perović, as well as the government of Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. Two days prior to its ousting, the Cvetković government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact (Axis). The coup had been planned for several months, but the signing of the Tripartite Pact spurred the organisers to carry it out, encouraged by the British Special Operations Executive. The military conspirators brought to power the 17-year-old King Peter II, whom they declared to be of age to assume the throne, and a weak and divided government of national unity was formed with Simović as prime minister and Vladko Maček and Slobodan Jovanović as his vice-premiers. The coup led directly to the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. The importance of the putsch and subsequent invasion in delaying Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, is disputed but most scholars now consider that it had no significant impact on the eventual outcome of that campaign.\nevents: t0: 27 March 1941, t1: 1938, t2: several months, e0: replaced, e1: installed, e2: planned, e3: conducted, e4: associated, e5: overthrow, e6: aware, e7: launched, e8: moved, e9: support, e10: occurred, e11: contribution, e12: occurred, e13: deposed, e14: signed, e15: planned, e16: carry, e17: encouraged, e18: brought, e19: declared, e20: formed, e21: invasion, e22: disputed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The event also left scores seriously wounded or maimed. Jewish homes were pillaged and synagogues were ransacked. Some of the 435 Jews who survived were hidden by local Arab families, although the extent of this phenomenon is debated. Soon after, all Hebron's Jews were evacuated by the British authorities. Many returned in 1931, but almost all were evacuated at the outbreak of the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine. The massacre formed part of the 1929 Palestine riots, in which a total of 133 Jews and 110 Arabs were killed, and brought the centuries-old Jewish presence in Hebron to an end. The massacre, together with that of Jews in Safed, sent shock waves through Jewish communities in Palestine and around the world.

The second tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from a frontal low off the west coast of Florida on August 3. Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. Early on August 4, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. After reaching hurricane strength on August 5 south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg) at 0600 UTC on August 7. The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass, Texas later that day at peak strength. Once inland, the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened, degenerating into a tropical storm on August 8 before dissipating over Arkansas on August 10. Reports of a potentially destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate prior to the storm moving inland. Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4 ft (1.95 m) on the western edge of Lake Pontchartrain. The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the US Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. However, much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. Rainfall peaked at 37.5 in (953 mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana recorded record-level 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August as a result of the slow-moving hurricane. Property, livestock, and crops–especially cotton, corn, and pecan crops–were heavily damaged. Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall. Overall, the storm caused $10.75 million in damages and seven fatalities.\nevents: t0: 1940, t1: August 1940, t2: August 3, t3: August 4, t4: August 7, t5: August 5, t6: August 10, t7: August 8, t8: 24-hour, e0: hurricane, e1: caused, e2: flooding, e3: cyclone, e4: hurricane, e5: formed, e6: disturbance, e7: moved, e8: gaining, e9: depression, e10: attained, e11: storm, e12: storm, e13: reported, e14: cyclone, e15: suggested, e16: reaching, e17: storm, e18: strengthened, e19: hurricane, e20: hurricane, e21: moved, e22: storm, e23: weakened, e24: degenerating, e25: storm, e26: dissipating, e27: hurricane, e28: forced, e29: evacuate, e30: storm, e31: moving, e32: hurricane, e33: generated, e34: storm, e35: flooded, e36: caused, e37: damage, e38: disrupted, e39: damage, e40: hurricane, e41: produced, e42: setting off, e43: floods, e44: cyclone, e45: recorded, e46: hurricane, e47: damaged, e48: altered, e49: storm, e50: caused, e51: damages, e52: fatalities\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The fair features multiples stages with live entertainment, DJs, food vendors, community-group stalls as well as a curated artisan alley with dozens of Northern California artists. Due to community pressure the fair restructured the organization and partnered with local charities to collect gate donations and partner with groups at the beverage and beer booths to raise money for those charities. The Castro Street Fair was founded by Harvey Milk, and the group he led, the Castro Valley Association, in 1974. It attracted over 5,000 people. The event's popularity grew quickly and by 1977, the attendance reached 70,000. The influx of visitors helped promote the Castro district's growing tourist industry. Castro Street Fair is one of San Francisco's many street fairs, including the North Beach Festival, Union Street Festival and Haight Street Fair. These fairs run throughout the summer, from spring to fall. The Castro Street fair takes place on the afternoon of the first Sunday in October.

The revolution, which occurred at the same time as revolutions in France and Liège, led to the brief overthrow of Habsburg rule and the proclamation of a short-lived polity, the United Belgian States. The revolution was the product of opposition which emerged to the liberal reforms of Emperor Joseph II in the 1780s. These were perceived as an attack on the Catholic Church and the traditional institutions in the Austrian Netherlands. Resistance, focused in the autonomous and wealthy Estates of Brabant and Flanders, grew. In the aftermath of rioting and disruption in 1787, known as the Small Revolution, many dissidents took refuge in the neighboring Dutch Republic where they formed a rebel army. Soon after the outbreak of the French and Liège revolutions, this "émigré" army crossed into the Austrian Netherlands and decisively defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Turnhout in October 1789. The rebels, supported by uprisings across the territory, soon took control over virtually all the Southern Netherlands and proclaimed independence. Despite the tacit support of Prussia, the independent United Belgian States, established in January 1790, received no foreign recognition and the rebels soon became divided along ideological lines. The Vonckists, led by Jan Frans Vonck, advocated progressive and liberal government, whereas the Statists, led by Hendrik Van der Noot, were staunchly conservative and supported by the Church. The Statists, who had a wider base of support, soon drove the Vonckists into exile through a terror. By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria ended its war with the Ottoman Empire and prepared to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly overrun by Imperial forces, and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars. Because of its distinctive course, the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution. Some historians, following Henri Pirenne, have seen it as a key moment in the formation of a Belgian nation-state, and an influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830.\nevents: t0: october 1789, t1: december 1790, t2: 1787, t3: October 1789, t4: January 1790, t5: mid-1790, t6: 1780s, t7: 1830, t8: December, e0: revolution, e1: referred, e2: revolution, e3: armed, e4: insurrection, e5: occurred, e6: revolution, e7: occurred, e8: revolutions, e9: led to, e10: overthrow, e11: rule, e12: proclamation, e13: revolution, e14: opposition, e15: emerged, e16: reforms, e17: perceived, e18: attack, e19: Resistance, e20: focused, e21: grew, e22: rioting, e23: disruption, e24: Revolution, e25: formed, e26: outbreak, e27: revolutions, e28: crossed, e29: defeated, e30: Battle, e31: supported, e32: took, e33: proclaimed, e34: support, e35: established, e36: received, e37: divided, e38: advocated, e39: supported, e40: support, e41: drove, e42: exile, e43: ended, e44: war, e45: prepared, e46: suppress, e47: revolutionaries, e48: proposed, e49: amnesty, e50: overcome, e51: Battle, e52: overrun, e53: revolution, e54: defeated, e55: reestablishment, e56: overrun, e57: Wars, e58: revolution, e59: used, e60: comparisons, e61: revolution, e62: seen, e63: formation, e64: influence, e65: revolution\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Thirty-three men, trapped underground and from the mine\'s entrance via spiraling underground ramps, were rescued after 69 days. After the state-owned mining company, Codelco, took over rescue efforts from the mine\'s owners, exploratory boreholes were drilled, and seventeen days after the accident a note was found taped to a drill bit pulled back to the surface: ("We are well in the shelter, the 33 of us"). Three separate drilling rig teams, nearly every Chilean government ministry, the United States\' NASA space agency, and a dozen corporations from around the world cooperated completing the rescue. On 13 October 2010 the men were winched to the surface one at a time, in a specially built capsule, as an estimated 1 billion people worldwide watched. With few exceptions all were in good medical condition with no long-term physical effects anticipated. Private donations covered one-third of the US$20 million cost of the rescue, with the rest coming from the mine owners and the government. Previous geological instability at the old mine and a long record of safety violations for the mine\'s owners, San Esteban Mining Company, had resulted in a series of fines and accidents, including eight deaths, during the dozen years leading up to this accident.

Headed by Major Allan Wilson, the patrol was attacked just north of the Shangani River in Matabeleland, Rhodesia. Its dramatic last stand, sometimes called "Wilson\'s Last Stand", achieved a prominent place in the British public imagination and, subsequently, in Rhodesian history, similarly to events such as the Battle of The Little Bighorn in the United States, the Battle of Shiroyama in Japan, the Battle of the Alamo in Texas, and the Greeks\' last stand at Thermopylae. The patrol comprised elements of the Mashonaland Mounted Police and the Bechuanaland Border Police. Scouting ahead of Major Patrick Forbes\'s column attempting the capture of the Matabele King Lobengula (following his flight from his capital Bulawayo a month before), it crossed the Shangani late on 3 December 1893. It moved on Lobengula the next morning, but was ambushed by a host of Matabele riflemen and warriors near the king\'s wagon. Surrounded and outnumbered about a hundred-fold, the patrol made a last stand as three of its number broke out and rode back to the river to muster reinforcements from Forbes. However, the Shangani had risen significantly in flood, and Forbes was himself involved in a skirmish near the southern bank; Wilson and his men therefore remained isolated to the north. After fighting to the last cartridge, and killing over ten times their own number, they were annihilated. The patrol\'s members, particularly Wilson and Captain Henry Borrow, were elevated in death to the status of national heroes, representing endeavour in the face of insurmountable odds. The anniversary of the battle on 4 December 1893 became an annual public holiday in Rhodesia two years later, and was an official non-work day until 1920. A historical war film depicting the episode, "Shangani Patrol", was produced and released in 1970. Controversy surrounds the breakout before the last stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele "inDuna" (leader) later claimed had been given to two unidentified men from Forbes\'s rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.\nevents: t0: 1893, t1: 3 December 1893, t2: 4 December 1893, t3: 1920, t4: 1970, t5: 2 December, e0: ambushed, e1: annihilated, e2: attacked, e3: achieved, e4: comprised, e5: crossed, e6: moved, e7: ambushed, e8: made, e9: broke out, e10: risen, e11: flood, e12: involved, e13: fighting, e14: killing, e15: elevated, e16: battle, e17: became, e18: depicting, e19: produced, e20: released, e21: claimed, e22: given, e23: stop, e24: found, e25: accepting, e26: keeping, e27: passing, e28: overturned\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Using rockets fired on several Israeli towns as a diversion, Hezbollah militants crossed from Lebanon into Israel and ambushed two Israeli Army vehicles, killing three soldiers and capturing two other soldiers. Another five soldiers were killed inside Lebanese territory in a failed rescue attempt. Hezbollah demanded the release of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel in exchange for the release of the captured soldiers. Israel refused and launched a large-scale ground and air campaign across Lebanon in response to the Hezbollah raid. This marked the start of the 2006 Lebanon War. Two years later, on 16 July 2008, the bodies of the two captured soldiers were returned to Israel by Hezbollah in exchange for Samir Kuntar and four Hezbollah prisoners.

Since 1906, the flag had been flown every day of the year. This was changed to no more than 18 days a year, which is in line with British government guidelines regarding government buildings. The move to limit the number of days was backed by the council's Irish nationalists and the Alliance Party; it was opposed by the unionist councillors. As a response, Ulster loyalists held street protests throughout Northern Ireland. They see the Council's decision as part of a wider 'cultural war' against 'Britishness' in Northern Ireland. On the night of the vote, protesters tried to storm City Hall. Throughout December and January, protests were held almost daily and most involved the protesters blocking roads while carrying Union Flags and banners. Some of these protests led to clashes between loyalists and the police, sparking riots. Rioters attacked police with petrol bombs, bricks, stones and fireworks; police responded with plastic bullets and water cannon. Alliance Party offices and the homes of Alliance Party members were attacked, while Belfast City Councillors were sent death threats. According to police, some of the violence was orchestrated by high-ranking members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Loyalists also put up thousands of Union flags in public places, which further heightened tension.

The victims had all taken Tylenol-branded acetaminophen capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide. A total of seven people died in the original poisonings, with several more deaths in subsequent copycat crimes. No suspect was ever charged or convicted of the poisonings. New York City resident James William Lewis was convicted of extortion for sending a letter to Johnson & Johnson that took credit for the deaths and demanded $1 million to stop them, but evidence tying him to the actual poisoning never emerged. The incidents led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter substances and to federal anti-tampering laws.

The battle was part of the First Battle of Flanders, in which German, French, Belgian armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fought from Arras in France to Nieuport on the Belgian coast, from 10 October to mid-November. The battles at Ypres began at the end of the Race to the Sea, reciprocal attempts by the German and Franco-British armies to advance past the northern flank of their opponents. North of Ypres, the fighting continued in the Battle of the Yser between the German 4th Army, the Belgian army and French marines. The fighting has been divided into five stages, an encounter battle from 19 to 21 October, the Battle of Langemarck from 21 to 24 October, the battles at La Bassée and Armentières to 2 November, coincident with more Allied attacks at Ypres and the Battle of Gheluvelt a fourth phase with the last big German offensive, which culminated at the Battle of Nonne Bosschen on 11 November, then local operations which faded out in late November. Brigadier-General James Edmonds, the British official historian, wrote in the History of the Great War, that the II Corps battle at La Bassée could be taken as separate but that the battles from Armentières to Messines and Ypres, were better understood as one battle in two parts, an offensive by III Corps and the Cavalry Corps from 12 to 18 October against which the Germans retired and an offensive by the German 6th Army and 4th Army from 19 October to 2 November, which from 30 October, took place mainly north of the Lys, when the battles of Armentières and Messines merged with the Battles of Ypres. Attacks by the BEF (Field Marshal Sir John French) the Belgians and the French Eighth Army in Belgium made little progress beyond Ypres. The German 4th and 6th Armies took small amounts of ground at great cost to both sides, during the Battle of the Yser and further south at Ypres. General Erich von Falkenhayn, head of the ("OHL", German General Staff), then tried a limited offensive to capture Ypres and Mont Kemmel, from 19 October to 22 November. Neither side had moved forces to Flanders fast enough to obtain a decisive victory and by November both sides were exhausted. The armies were short of ammunition, suffering from low morale and some infantry units refused orders. The autumn battles in Flanders had become static, attrition operations, unlike the battles of manoeuvre in the summer. French, British and Belgian troops in improvised field defences, repulsed German attacks for four weeks. From 21 to 23 October, German reservists had made mass attacks at Langemarck, with losses of up to to little effect. Warfare between mass armies, equipped with the weapons of the Industrial Revolution and its later developments, proved to be indecisive, because field fortifications neutralised many classes of offensive weapon. The defensive use of artillery and machine guns, dominated the battlefield and the ability of the armies to supply themselves and replace casualties prolonged battles for weeks. Thirty-four German divisions fought in the Flanders battles, against twelve French, nine British and six Belgian, along with marines and dismounted cavalry. Falkenhayn reconsidered German strategy over the winter, because and a dictated peace against France and Russia had been shown to be beyond German resources. Falkenhayn intended to detach Russia or France from the Allied coalition by diplomatic as well as military action. A strategy of attrition () would make the cost of the war too great for the Allies, until one made a separate peace. The remaining belligerents would have to negotiate or face the Germans concentrated on the remaining front, which would be sufficient to obtain a decisive victory.\nevents: t0: 10 october, t1: mid-november, t2: 21, t3: 24 October, t4: 19, t5: 21 October, t6: 2 November, t7: late November, t8: 11 November, t9: 12, t10: 18 October, t11: 19 October, t12: 2 November, t13: 19 october, t14: 22 november, t15: 21, t16: 23 October, t17: weeks, t18: 30 October, t19: November, t20: four weeks, t21: the First World War, e0: Battle, e1: battle, e2: War, e3: fought, e4: battle, e5: battle, e6: fought, e7: battles, e8: began, e9: end, e10: advance, e11: fighting, e12: Battle, e13: fighting, e14: battle, e15: Battle, e16: battles, e17: attacks, e18: Battle, e19: culminated, e20: Battle, e21: operations, e22: faded, e23: wrote in, e24: War, e25: battle, e26: taken, e27: battles, e28: understood, e29: battle, e30: offensive, e31: retired, e32: offensive, e33: took place, e34: battles, e35: merged, e36: Battles, e37: Attacks, e38: progress, e39: took, e40: cost, e41: Battle, e42: offensive, e43: capture, e44: moved, e45: obtain, e46: exhausted, e47: suffering, e48: refused, e49: orders, e50: battles, e51: become, e52: operations, e53: battles, e54: repulsed, e55: attacks, e56: attacks, e57: losses, e58: effect, e59: warfare, e60: equipped, e61: revolution, e62: developments, e63: proved, e64: neutralised, e65: use, e66: dominated, e67: supply, e68: fought, e69: battles, e70: reconsidered, e71: detach, e72: coalition, e73: attrition, e74: make, e75: cost, e76: war, e77: negotiate, e78: face, e79: obtain, e80: victory\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Approximately one-fifth of Pakistan's total land area was affected by floods, with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province facing the brunt of the damage and casualties (above 90% of the deaths occurred in that Province). According to Pakistani government data, the floods directly affected about 20 million people, mostly by destruction of property, livelihood and infrastructure, with a death toll of close to 2,000. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had initially asked for US$460 million (€420 million) for emergency relief, noting that the flood was the worst disaster he had ever seen. Only 20% of the relief funds requested had been received on 15 August 2010. The U.N. had been concerned that aid was not arriving fast enough, and the World Health Organization reported that ten million people were forced to drink unsafe water. The Pakistani economy was harmed by extensive damage to infrastructure and crops. Damage to structures was estimated to exceed US$4 billion (€2.5 billion), and wheat crop damages were estimated to be over US$500 million (€425 million).

The hurricane formed on October 14 in the western Caribbean, slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward. By October 16, the storm attained hurricane status to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula, and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop. On October 18, the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening and, on the next day, reached an estimated peak intensity of 165 mph (270 km/h). Shortly thereafter, it struck extreme western Cuba at peak intensity, becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country. Later the hurricane weakened greatly, striking southwestern Florida with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) in a sparsely populated region. While crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status, and after accelerating east-northeastward, it was absorbed by a cold front on October 23, to the south of Bermuda. Across the western Caribbean Sea, the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds. Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage, with two small towns nearly destroyed. About 90 people were killed in the country, all in Pinar del Río Province. Later, the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida, which caused flooding and crop damage. Damage was light in the state, and there were no casualties.\nevents: t0: 1924, t1: October 14, t2: October 16, t3: October 18, t4: the next day, t5: October 23, t6: 2017, e0: hurricane, e1: tied, e2: formed, e3: organizing, e4: tracked, e5: executed, e6: began, e7: deepening, e8: becoming, e9: weakened, e10: weakened, e11: storm, e12: accelerating, e13: absorbed, e14: developing, e15: produced, e16: destroyed, e17: killed, e18: brought, e19: caused, e20: casualties\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Both teams had previously reached the final but been defeated by Wanderers. The Engineers had reached the final with comparative ease, scoring sixteen goals and conceding only one in the four previous rounds. Oxford's opponents in the earlier rounds had included two-time former winners Wanderers. The final was decided by two goals from Oxford in the first twenty minutes.

On Wednesday, December 23, 1964, Flying Tiger Line Flight 282 arrived at San Francisco International Airport from Japan. Filled with a cargo of electronic equipment, bolts of fabric, women\'s scarves, bandannas, purses, and costume jewelry for the Christmas holiday, the craft was refueled and departed just after midnight with a crew of three, of cargo, of mail, and 5,000 gallons of high-octane aviation fuel. The weather was that of heavy fog and rain. A large cold frontal system was moving onshore, and on the north coast of California heavy flooding was destroying homes. A Coast Guard helicopter had already been lost in these conditions. Leaving just after midnight on December 24 from Runway 28, going northwest from the bay, flight 282 planned to head out over the ocean to circle and gain altitude, then travel east toward its destination of JFK International Airport in New York City. Shortly after takeoff, however, the plane veered to the left of its planned course. The pilot, Jabez A. Richards, 49, of Bayhead, New Jersey, asked the tower for permission to change his radio setting from takeoff to departure frequency. With him were Daniel W. Hennessy, 33, of Hillsborough, California, as co-pilot, and Paul M. Entz, 37, of North Hollywood, California, as flight engineer. Seconds later, the plane vanished from the tower\'s radar scope. The "Super Connie" crashed near the top of Sweeney Ridge in San Bruno, very close to the site of a Coast Guard radio station. All three crew members aboard were killed. No one on the ground was killed or injured. The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was that the pilot, for undetermined reasons, deviated from departure course into an area of rising terrain, where downdraft activity and turbulence affected the ability of the craft to climb.\nevents: t0: Wednesday , December 23 , 1964, t1: December 24, t2: the early morning hours of Thursday , December 24 , 1964, e0: refers, e1: take-off, e2: arrived at, e3: Filled, e4: departed, e5: moving, e6: destroying, e7: lost, e8: Leaving, e9: going, e10: planned, e11: gain, e12: travel, e13: takeoff, e14: veered, e15: asked, e16: permission, e17: setting, e18: takeoff, e19: departure, e20: crashed, e21: killed, e22: killed, e23: injured, e24: determined, e25: cause, e26: deviated, e27: rising, e28: affected, e29: climb\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

In the aftermath of the major Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) victory at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, the United Nations Command (UN) started to contemplate the possibility of evacuation from the Korean Peninsula. China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to cross the 38th Parallel in an effort to pressure the UN forces to withdraw from South Korea. On December 31, 1950, the Chinese 13th Army attacked the Republic of Korea Army (ROK)'s 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th Infantry Divisions along the 38th Parallel, breaching UN defenses at the Imjin River, Hantan River, Gapyeong and Chuncheon in the process. To prevent the PVA forces from overwhelming the defenders, the US Eighth Army now under the command of Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway evacuated Seoul on January 3, 1951. Although PVA forces captured Seoul by the end of the battle, the Chinese invasion of South Korea galvanized the UN support for South Korea, while the idea of evacuation was soon abandoned by the UN Command. At the same time, the PVA were exhausted after months of nonstop fighting since the start of the Chinese intervention, thereby allowing the UN forces to regain the initiative in Korea.\nevents: t0: December 31 , 1950, t1: January 7 , 1951, t2: December 31 , 1950, t3: January 3 , 1951, e0: battle, e1: victory, e2: started, e3: ordered, e4: cross, e5: pressure, e6: withdraw, e7: attacked, e8: breaching, e9: defenses, e10: prevent, e11: command, e12: evacuated, e13: captured, e14: galvanized, e15: support, e16: abandoned, e17: exhausted, e18: fighting, e19: allowing, e20: regain\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Similar to Ringo Starr\'s "All Starr Band" tours, each successive year the band members swapped out and featured the songs of the new line-up. The first set included all band members assembled to play each other\'s hits. The second set featured all Beatles songs performed by various band members depending on the specific tune and the strength and style of the performer. Although certainly successful enough to continue over two years, the show was mired by some problems, not the least of which was prohibitive concessions having to be paid to The Beatles for the use of the name "Abbey Road". An obvious play on concert-goers expectations with Who bassist John Entwistle in the group, the second song of the opening set was "Open My Eyes" from Todd Rundgren\'s first band, The Nazz. The chord pattern at the beginning is lifted directly from The Who\'s "I Can\'t Explain".

According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the battle took place "about two months" after a prior loss to the Danes at the Battle of Basing, in which both sides suffered heavy losses. King Æthelred of Wessex and Prince Alfred fought against the Danes, who were possibly under the leadership of King Halfdan Ragnarsson, who had commanded many of the earlier battles that year. The Chronicle tells us that the forces were split in two and that the Danes were initially put to flight, but at the end of the day and after "much slaughter" the Danes remained masters of the field. Among the fallen was Bishop Heahmund. It was the last of the battles known to be fought by Æthelred against the Danes that year, and the defeated King is reported to have died on 15 April 871. Whether he died in battle, or as a result of wounds suffered in battle is unclear. The site of the battle is unknown. Suggestions include the borders of the London Borough of Merton, Merton in Oxfordshire, Merdon Castle (Hursley parish near Winchester) in Hampshire, Marden in Wiltshire, Marten in Wiltshire or Martin in Dorset. The more westerly locations tend to be favoured because King Æthelred was buried in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, shortly afterwards. Another possible location for the battle is at Merritown, on the River Stour, a few miles downstream of Wimborne, thus providing a short journey with the body of King Æthelred.

On 23 March 1994, the aircraft operating the route, an Airbus A310-304 flown by Aeroflot – Russian International Airlines, crashed into a mountain range in Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, killing all 63 passengers and 12 crew members on board. No evidence of a technical malfunction was found. Cockpit voice and flight data recorders revealed the presence of the relief pilot's 12-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son on the flight deck. While seated at the controls, the pilot's son had unknowingly disengaged the A310's autopilot control of the aircraft's ailerons. The autopilot then disengaged completely causing the aircraft to roll into a steep bank and a near-vertical dive. Despite managing to level the aircraft, the first officer over-corrected when pulling up, causing the plane to stall and enter into a corkscrew dive; the pilots managed to level the aircraft off once more, but by then the plane had lost too much altitude to recover and crashed into the Kuznetsk Alatau mountain range.\nevents: t0: 23 March 1994, e0: operating, e1: flown, e2: crashed, e3: killing, e4: malfunction, e5: found, e6: revealed, e7: presence, e8: seated, e9: disengaged, e10: control, e11: disengaged, e12: causing, e13: roll into, e14: dive, e15: managing, e16: level, e17: pulling, e18: causing, e19: stall, e20: enter, e21: dive, e22: level, e23: lost, e24: recover, e25: crashed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

It was the largest naval convoy operation since World War II. The U.S. Navy warships that escorted the tankers, part of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, were the operations\' most visible part, but U.S. Air Force AWACS radar planes provided surveillance and U.S. Army special-operations helicopters hunted for possible attackers. Other U.S. Navy vessels participated in Operation Earnest Will. They were then under the command of the U.S. Navy\'s Seventh Fleet which had primary responsibility for combat operations in the Persian Gulf region. The numerous ships used in Operation Earnest Will mostly consisted of Carrier Battle Groups, Surface Action Groups and ships from the Pacific\'s Third and Seventh Fleets and the Mediterranean-based Sixth Fleet. They generally operated in and near the Gulf for parts of their normal six-month deployments.

According to the official report, the crash was non-survivable. The crash is the deadliest aviation incident in the Mediterranean Sea to date. Among the dead was French general René Cogny. The probable cause was attributed to a fire which originated in the rear of the cabin. A radio programme broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 26 November 2007 advanced the theory that the accident was the result of a missile strike or bomb, and that the true cause has been suppressed by the French Government under secrecy laws. On 10 May 2011 Michel Laty, a former army typist, alleged on French television channel TF1 that he saw a report indicating a missile, misfired by the French army during a weapon test, in fact caused the crash. A 2019 article in "The Guardian" newspaper reported that after the crash, documents and photographs about it disappeared. The 11 September page in the log book for "Le Suffren", a French Navy missile frigate in the area, was torn out. The aircraft\'s black box flight recorder was said to have been damaged, with the recording of flight AF1611 unreadable, although earlier flights were recorded. Wreckage recovered was seized by France\'s military. An investigation was started in 2011 by gendarmes, and in September 2019 the theory that a fire had started in a toilet was disproved. A family member of one of those killed said "The investigating judge has said he is practically certain to almost 100% that the plane was hit by a missile. Now we are waiting". French president Emmanuel Macron wrote to a victim\'s family saying that he hoped the affair would be declassified, and that he had asked the armed forces minister to begin the process of releasing documents related to the crash. Official report from French transport ministry. In December 1972 BEA, the French air accident investigation bureau, published its official report. This rejected the suggestion of any missile strike, basing its findings on the aircraft\'s survival time after the pilot\'s initial report to air traffic control of a fire on board, the examination of the wreckage recovered from the seabed, knowledge of a similar accidental fire in another Sud Aviation Caravelle and the declaration by the French defence ministry that there were no surface ships in the area capable of launching missiles. The report surmised that the loss of the aircraft had been caused by a fire in the passenger toilet caused either by a defective water heater or a cigarette discarded in a waste bin.\nevents: t0: 2019, t1: 11 September, t2: 2011, t3: 11 september 1968, t4: 26 November 2007, t5: 10 May 2011, t6: September 2019, t7: December 1972, e0: crashed, e1: killing, e2: crash, e3: crash, e4: incident, e5: dead, e6: cause, e7: attributed, e8: fire, e9: originated, e10: advanced, e11: accident, e12: strike, e13: cause, e14: suppressed, e15: alleged, e16: saw, e17: indicating, e18: test, e19: caused, e20: crash, e21: reported, e22: crash, e23: disappeared, e24: torn, e25: said, e26: damaged, e27: recorded, e28: recovered, e29: seized, e30: investigation, e31: started, e32: fire, e33: started, e34: killed, e35: said, e36: said, e37: hit, e38: waiting, e39: wrote, e40: saying, e41: declassified, e42: asked, e43: begin, e44: releasing, e45: crash, e46: report, e47: transport, e48: published, e49: rejected, e50: suggestion, e51: strike, e52: basing, e53: findings, e54: examination, e55: recovered, e56: declaration, e57: launching, e58: surmised, e59: loss, e60: caused, e61: fire, e62: caused, e63: discarded\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

This strike finally ended some 45 days later, after it was put down by local and state militias, and federal troops. Because of economic problems and pressure on wages by the railroads, workers in numerous other cities, in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, into Illinois and Missouri, also went out on strike. An estimated 100 people were killed in the unrest across the country. In Martinsburg, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and other cities, workers burned down and destroyed both physical facilities and the rolling stock of the railroads—engines and railroad cars. Local populations feared that workers were rising in revolution such as the Paris Commune of 1871. At the time, the workers were not represented by trade unions. The city and state governments organized armed militias, aided by national guard, federal troops and private militias organized by the railroads, who fought against the workers. Disruption was widespread and at its height, the strikes were supported by about 100,000 workers. With the intervention of federal troops in several locations, most of the strikes were suppressed by early August. Labor continued to work to organize into unions to work for better wages and conditions. Fearing the social disruption, many cities built armories to support their militias; these defensive buildings still stand as symbols of the effort to suppress the labor unrest of this period. With public attention on workers' wages and conditions, the B&O in 1880 founded an Employee Relief Association to provide death benefits and some health care. In 1884 it established a worker pension plan. Other improvements generally had to await further economic growth and associated wage increases.\nevents: t0: 1877, t1: July 14, t2: a year, t3: 45 days, t4: 1871, t5: early August, t6: 1884, t7: 1880, e0: referred, e1: began, e2: ended, e3: went out, e4: killed, e5: burned, e6: destroyed, e7: feared, e8: rising, e9: represented, e10: organized, e11: aided, e12: organized, e13: fought, e14: supported, e15: suppressed, e16: work, e17: organize, e18: work, e19: built, e20: support, e21: stand, e22: suppress, e23: founded, e24: provide, e25: established, e26: plan, e27: associated\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The concert, conceived by South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and record producer Stewart Levine, was meant to be a major promotional event for the heavyweight boxing championship match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, known as The Rumble in the Jungle. When an injury forced Foreman to postpone the fight by six weeks, the festival's intended audience of international tourists was all but eliminated and Levine had to decide whether or not to cancel the event. The decision was made to move forward, and 80,000 people attended. In addition to promoting the Ali-Foreman fight, the Zaire 74 event was intended to present and promote racial and cultural solidarity between African American and African people. Thirty one performing groups, 17 from Zaire and 14 from overseas, performed. Featured performers included top R&B and soul artists from the United States such as James Brown, Bill Withers, B.B. King, and The Spinners as well as prominent African performers such as Miriam Makeba, TPOK Jazz, and Tabu Ley Rochereau.

The operation began on 29 October 1991 and ended on 3 January 1992 when a nationwide ceasefire was signed to implement the Vance plan. The offensive was aimed at recapturing the region, in conjunction with two other HV offensives launched against SAO Western Slavonia in the north of the region within days. Even though the offensive captured a portion of the targeted area, including the town of Lipik as the first of the larger settlements captured by the HV during the war, the mission objectives were not met before the ceasefire took effect. SAO Western Slavonia retained control of the town of Okučani and its surroundings, including a short section of the Zagreb–Slavonski Brod motorway. The halting of Operation Hurricane-91 due to the ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to opposing assessments on the possible outcomes of the offensive had there been no ceasefire. Assessments range from claims that the JNA was on the brink of defeat in the area, to estimates that the HV was too exhausted and its ammunition stocks too low to permit a successful conclusion of the offensive. The three HV offensives launched in Western Slavonia in late-1991 led to the displacement of approximately 20,000 Croatian Serb refugees who were later settled in the JNA-held Baranja region in eastern Croatia.\nevents: t0: 29 October 1991, t1: 3 January 1992, t2: 3 January 1992, t3: late-1991, t4: days, e0: operation, e1: undertaken, e2: began, e3: ended, e4: signed, e5: implement, e6: aimed, e7: launched, e8: captured, e9: captured, e10: met, e11: took effect, e12: retained, e13: ceasefire, e14: led to, e15: assessments, e16: claims, e17: estimates, e18: permit, e19: launched, e20: led to, e21: settled\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The rebels were led by the Younger Khoja (also known as Khwāja-i Jahān), leader of the . Qing era documents refer to the event as the "Pacification of the Muslim regions" (). Hojijan and his brother, the Elder Khoja (also known as Burhān al-Dīn), were members of the Central Asian Muslim Zhuo (卓) Clan. After the Qing at the end of the Dzungar–Qing Wars in 1755, the Khoja Brothers were released from Dzungar captivity whereupon they began to recruit followers in the Western Regions around Altishahr. Not long afterwards, the Khoit-Oirat prince Amursana rose up against the Qing and the Khoja Brothers used the opportunity to seize control of the south west part of Xinjiang. In 1757, Hojijan killed the Qing Amindao (). Qianlong retaliated the following year by sending troops to locations including Kuqa County, (modern day Yarkant County) and Hotan () to attack the Zhuo brothers. In 1759, the rebel army fled west through the Pamir Mountains to Badakhshan (now part of north east Afghanistan) where it was captured and destroyed by the ruling Sultan Shah, causing the revolt to subside. With the revolt pacified, the Qing completed the reintegration of their territory in one of Qianlong\'s Ten Great Campaigns. The end of the conflict saw the restoration of the territory south of the Tian Shan to Qing control meaning that the Qing now controlled the whole of Xinjiang.

The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War, First Iraq War or Iraq War, before the term "Iraq War" became identified instead with the post-2003 Iraq War. The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board US bombers during Operation Desert Storm. On 2 August 1990 the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied Kuwait, which was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council. Together with the UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who had resisted the invasion by Argentina of the Falkland Islands a decade earlier, American President George H. W. Bush deployed US forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II. The great majority of the coalition\'s military forces were from the US, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost. The war marked the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the US network CNN. The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, continuing for five weeks. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The coalition ceased its advance and declared a ceasefire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia\'s border. Iraq launched Scud missiles against coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.\nevents: t0: 2 August 1990, t1: 17 January 1991, t2: five weeks, t3: 24 February, t4: february 1991, t5: january 1991, t6: february 1991, t7: post-2003, t8: World War II, t9: 100 hours, e0: defense, e1: storm, e2: combat, e3: response, e4: invasion, e5: arising, e6: known, e7: became, e8: earned, e9: invaded, e10: occupied, e11: met with, e12: brought, e13: resisted, e14: deployed, e15: urged, e16: send, e17: joined, e18: forming, e19: paid, e20: cost, e21: marked, e22: battle, e23: conflict, e24: began, e25: assault, e26: advanced, e27: ceased, e28: declared, e29: started, e30: combat, e31: launched\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The Braathens SAFE aircraft was en route from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. While passing Røros the Heron started experiencing a rapidly accelerating atmospheric icing which soon was too extensive for the ice protection system to handle. Combined with downdraft, the aircraft lost sufficient lift to stay airborne. The pilots were able to turn around the aircraft, but it hit Hummelfjell at an altitude of above mean sea level. The aircraft's captain was killed in the impact and a passenger died shortly afterwards. Ten people survived the crash, which was the first fatal accident of Braathens SAFE. Amongst the survivors was Rolf Kirkvaag, at the time Norway's most popular radio host. The search and rescue operation was severely hindered by a blizzard and poor visibility. Kirkvaag and another person left the plane after a day and met a rescue party. The investigation concluded that there were neither technical faults with the aircraft nor pilot error, and that it was not possible to predict the weather conditions which caused the icing.\nevents: t0: 7 November 1956, t1: 9:50, t2: a day, e0: Accident, e1: occurred, e2: crashed, e3: passing, e4: started, e5: experiencing, e6: accelerating, e7: Combined, e8: lost, e9: turn, e10: hit, e11: killed, e12: impact, e13: died, e14: crash, e15: accident, e16: search, e17: rescue, e18: operation, e19: hindered, e20: blizzard, e21: left, e22: met, e23: rescue, e24: investigation, e25: concluded, e26: caused, e27: icing\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The platform was situated within a block section between Hexthorpe Junction and Cherry Tree Lane and so had no signals of its own. The railway platform was a simple wooden structure on the Doncaster - bound line usually used for the collection of tickets from the many trains arriving in the town for the St. Leger race meeting. The usual method of working the section of line was to pass trains from Hexthorpe Junction under a \'permissive\' block ruling, not usually used on passenger lines, with additional control by two flagmen spaced between the junction box and the ticket platform. On this day two trains were in the section, the first, a Midland Railway train, stood at the platform, the second, another Midland train waiting just to its rear. As the first train moved off the second moved onto the platform so that tickets could be checked. The third train was a Liverpool to Hull express worked by a MS&LR crew and probably the crew who should have understood the working of the line better than any other. This train came over Hexthorpe Junction with, first the \'distant\' signal and then the \'home\' signal at danger. With speed down to a crawl the \'home\' signal was lowered, the driver assumed, wrongly, that with no other fixed signals to Cherry Tree Lane his route was clear and speed gradually rose. In the official report it was said that the first of the flagmen gave no indication and the second gave an ambiguous signal which was seen by the fireman but not properly understood. The express was reported travelling between 35 and 40 m.p.h. when they rounded the curve and saw the Midland train still in the platform. The driver applied the \'simple\' vacuum brake and threw the locomotive into reverse but could not stop within the short distance of less than 250 yards. The trial of the driver and fireman at York, before the Lord Chief Justice was the first big legal case in which the newly formed trade union A.S.L.E.F. were part and for which they engaged eminent counsel to defend their members. The jury returned a verdict of \'not guilty\' and the Lord Chief Justice said in his summing up that "...he could not but think that the railway company was seriously to blame for having had in use a brake which not only was not the best in existence, but which was known to be insufficient and liable to break down". The management were "thick skinned" over all safety matters and in this case Sir Edward Watkin, the company chairman, said "...it was a misfortune that the Lord Chief Justice should have exonerated the driver and fireman". Regardless of Sir Edward\'s thinking the Hexthorpe accident, closely followed by the Armagh rail disaster in Northern Ireland sounded the death knell of the \'simple\' vacuum brake.\nevents: t0: 16 September 1887, t1: this day, e0: occurred, e1: situated, e2: used, e3: arriving in, e4: race, e5: meeting, e6: pass, e7: block, e8: ruling, e9: used, e10: control, e11: stood, e12: waiting, e13: moved, e14: moved, e15: checked, e16: understood, e17: came, e18: lowered, e19: assumed, e20: rose, e21: said, e22: gave, e23: gave, e24: seen, e25: understood, e26: reported, e27: travelling, e28: rounded, e29: applied, e30: brake, e31: threw, e32: stop, e33: case, e34: formed, e35: defend, e36: returned, e37: said, e38: think, e39: blame, e40: use, e41: existence, e42: break down, e43: said, e44: exonerated, e45: thinking, e46: disaster, e47: sounded, e48: death\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The Ottoman forces were sailing westward from their naval station in "Lepanto" (the Venetian name of ancient "Naupactus" , Ottoman "") when they met the fleet of the Holy League which was sailing east from Messina, Sicily. The Spanish Empire and the Venetian Republic were the main powers of the coalition, as the league was largely financed by Philip II of Spain and Venice was the main contributor of ships. In the history of naval warfare, Lepanto marks the last major engagement in the Western world to be fought almost entirely between rowing vessels, namely the galleys and galeasses which were the direct descendants of ancient trireme warships. The battle was in essence an "infantry battle on floating platforms". It was the largest naval battle in Western history since classical antiquity, involving more than 400 warships. Over the following decades, the increasing importance of the galleon and the line of battle tactic would displace the galley as the major warship of its era, marking the beginning of the "Age of Sail". The victory of the Holy League is of great importance in the history of Europe and of the Ottoman Empire, marking the turning-point of Ottoman military expansion into the Mediterranean, although the Ottoman wars in Europe would continue for another century. It has long been compared to the Battle of Salamis, both for tactical parallels and for its crucial importance in the defense of Europe against imperial expansion. It was also of great symbolic importance in a period when Europe was torn by its own wars of religion following the Protestant Reformation. Pope Pius V instituted the feast of Our Lady of Victory, and Philip II of Spain used the victory to strengthen his position as the "Most Catholic King" and defender of Christendom against Muslim incursion. Historian Paul K. Davis writes that, "More than a military victory, Lepanto was a moral one. For decades, the Ottoman Turks had terrified Europe, and the victories of Suleiman the Magnificent caused Christian Europe serious concern. The defeat at Lepanto further exemplified the rapid deterioration of Ottoman might under Selim II, and Christians rejoiced at this setback for the Ottomans. The mystique of Ottoman power was tarnished significantly by this battle, and Christian Europe was heartened."\nevents: t0: 7 October 1571, t1: decades, t2: the following decades, e0: Battle, e1: engagement, e2: took place, e3: arranged, e4: sailing, e5: met, e6: sailing, e7: financed, e8: warfare, e9: engagement, e10: fought, e11: battle, e12: battle, e13: battle, e14: battle, e15: marking, e16: beginning, e17: victory, e18: marking, e19: expansion, e20: wars, e21: Battle, e22: defense, e23: expansion, e24: torn, e25: wars, e26: Reformation, e27: instituted, e28: used, e29: strengthen, e30: caused, e31: defeat, e32: exemplified, e33: deterioration, e34: setback, e35: tarnished, e36: battle, e37: heartened\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The sixteenth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a frontal trough in the Bay of Campeche on September 7. Within a weak steering environment, the storm meandered southwestward while gradually gaining strength. Though classified as a tropical storm operationally, data during a post-season review indicated that Nate briefly attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September 8. As a result of its slow motion, the storm caused significant upwelling, leading to a marked decrease in convection, and weakening accordingly. On September 11, Nate moved ashore Mexico as a tropical storm, producing several inches of rainfall and damaging several hundred structures. Ten oil rig workers went missing; seven were rescued, but one died of an unknown cause, and three other bodies were later recovered. In Veracruz, a boy was killed after being struck by lightning.\nevents: t0: mid-September 2011, t1: 2011, t2: September 7, t3: september 8, t4: September 11, e0: Hurricane, e1: caused, e2: damage, e3: named, e4: storm, e5: hurricane, e6: originated, e7: storm, e8: meandered, e9: gaining, e10: storm, e11: indicated, e12: attained, e13: hurricane, e14: hurricane, e15: storm, e16: caused, e17: upwelling, e18: leading to, e19: decrease, e20: weakening, e21: moved, e22: storm, e23: producing, e24: damaging, e25: rescued, e26: died, e27: cause, e28: recovered, e29: killed, e30: struck, e31: lightning\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

In 1115, Jurchen tribes rebelled against their overlords, the Khitan Liao dynasty (907–1125), and declared the formation of the Jin. Allying with the Song against their common enemy the Liao dynasty, the Jin promised to return to the Song the Sixteen Prefectures that had fallen under Liao control since 938. The Chinese agreed but the Jurchens\' quick defeat of the Liao dynasty combined with Song dynasty military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede these territories. After a series of negotiations that embittered both sides, the Jurchens attacked the Song dynasty in 1125, dispatching one army to Taiyuan and the other to Bianjing (modern Kaifeng), the Song capital. Surprised by news of an invasion, Song general Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan, which was besieged and later captured. As the second Jin army approached the capital, Song emperor Huizong abdicated and fled south. Qinzong, his eldest son, was enthroned. The Jurchens laid siege to Kaifeng in 1126, but Qinzong negotiated their retreat from the capital by agreeing to a large annual indemnity. Qinzong reneged on the deal and ordered Song forces to defend the prefectures instead of fortifying the capital. The Jin resumed war and again besieged Kaifeng in 1127. They captured Emperor Qinzong of Song, many members of the imperial family and high officials of the Song imperial court in an event known as the Jingkang Incident. This separated north and south China between Jin and Song. Remnants of the Song imperial family retreated to southern China and, after brief stays in several temporary capitals, eventually relocated to Lin\'an (modern Hangzhou). The retreat divided the dynasty into two distinct periods, Northern Song and Southern Song. The Jurchens tried to conquer southern China in the 1130s, but were bogged down by a pro-Song insurgency in the north and a counteroffensive by Song generals Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and others. The Song generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of Southern Song emperor Gaozong, who supported a peaceful resolution to the war. The Treaty of Shaoxing (1142) set the boundary of the two empires along the Huai River, but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of the Jin in 1234. A war against the Song begun by 4th Jin emperor, Wanyan Liang, was unsuccessful. He lost the Battle of Caishi (1161) and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers. An invasion of Jin territory motivated by Song revanchism (1206–1208) was also unsuccessful. A decade later, the Jin launched an abortive military campaign against the Song in 1217 to replace territory they had lost to the invading Mongols. The Song allied with the Mongols in 1233, and in the next year jointly captured Caizhou, last refuge of the Jin emperor. The Jin dynasty collapsed that year in 1234. After the demise of the Jin, the Song dynasty itself became a target of the Mongols, and collapsed in 1279. The wars engendered an era of swift technological, cultural, and demographic changes in China. Battles between the Song and Jin brought about the introduction of various gunpowder weapons. The siege of De\'an in 1132 was the first recorded use of the fire lance, an early ancestor of firearms. There were also reports of battles fought with rudimentary gunpowder bombs like the incendiary "huopao" or the exploding "tiehuopao", incendiary arrows, and other related weapons. In northern China, Jurchens were the ruling minority of an empire predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the Song. Jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture. The Jin, a conquest dynasty, instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous Chinese dynasties, basing their legitimacy on Confucian philosophy. Song refugees from the north resettled in southern China. The north was the cultural center of China, and its conquest by the Jin diminished the regional stature of the Song dynasty. The Southern Song, however, quickly returned to economic prosperity, and trade with the Jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare. Lin\'an, the Southern Song capital, expanded into a major city for commerce.\nevents: t0: 1115–1234, t1: 960–1279, t2: 1115, t3: 907–1125, t4: 938, t5: 1125, t6: 1126, t7: 1127, t8: 1142, t9: 1234, t10: 1161, t11: 1206–1208, t12: A decade later, t13: 1217, t14: 1233, t15: 1234, t16: 1279, t17: 1132, t18: the 1130s, e0: conflicts, e1: rebelled, e2: declared, e3: promised, e4: fallen, e5: control, e6: agreed, e7: defeat, e8: combined, e9: made, e10: attacked, e11: dispatching, e12: invasion, e13: retreated, e14: besieged, e15: captured, e16: approached, e17: abdicated, e18: fled, e19: enthroned, e20: siege, e21: negotiated, e22: retreat, e23: agreeing, e24: deal, e25: ordered, e26: defend, e27: fortifying, e28: resumed, e29: besieged, e30: captured, e31: separated, e32: retreated, e33: relocated, e34: regained, e35: retreated, e36: orders, e37: supported, e38: set, e39: conflicts, e40: fall, e41: begun, e42: lost, e43: assassinated, e44: invasion, e45: replace, e46: lost, e47: invading, e48: allied, e49: captured, e50: collapsed, e51: became, e52: collapsed, e53: changes, e54: Battles, e55: brought about, e56: siege, e57: recorded, e58: reports, e59: fought, e60: exploding, e61: ruling, e62: conquered, e63: assimilated, e64: instituted, e65: basing, e66: diminished, e67: returned, e68: trade, e69: expanded\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

This war consisted of a series of conflicts and minor wars, such as the Second Sacred War. There were several causes for the war including the building of the Athenian long walls, Megara's defection and the envy and concern felt by Sparta at the growth of the Athenian Empire. The First Peloponnesian War began in 460 BC with the Battle of Oenoe, where Spartan forces were defeated by those of Athenian-Argive alliance. At first the Athenians had the better of the fighting, winning the naval engagements using their superior fleet. They also had the better of the fighting on land, until 457 BC when the Spartans and their allies defeated the Athenian army at Tanagra. The Athenians, however, counterattacked and scored a crushing victory over the Boeotians at the Battle of Oenophyta and followed this victory up by conquering all of Boeotia except for Thebes. Athens further consolidated their position by making Aegina a member of the Delian League and by ravaging the Peloponnese. The Athenians were defeated in 454 BC by the Persians in Egypt which caused them to enter into a five years' truce with Sparta. However, the war flared up again in 448 BC with the start of the Second Sacred War. In 446 BC, Boeotia revolted and defeated the Athenians at Coronea and regained their independence. The First Peloponnesian War ended in an arrangement between Sparta and Athens, which was ratified by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445 BC). According to the provisions of this peace treaty, both sides maintained the main parts of their empires. Athens continued its domination of the sea while Sparta dominated the land. Megara returned to the Peloponnesian League and Aegina became a tribute-paying but autonomous member of the Delian League. The war between the two leagues restarted in 431 BC, leading to the Second Peloponnesian War. It ended with a conclusive Spartan victory, where, in 404 BC, Athens was occupied by Sparta.\nevents: t0: 460–445 BC, t1: 460 BC, t2: 454 BC, t3: 448 BC, t4: 446 BC, t5: 446–445 BC, t6: 431 BC, t7: 404 BC, t8: 457 BC, e0: fought, e1: war, e2: wars, e3: war, e4: began, e5: defeated, e6: winning, e7: using, e8: defeated, e9: counterattacked, e10: scored, e11: conquering, e12: consolidated, e13: making, e14: ravaging, e15: defeated, e16: caused, e17: enter, e18: flared, e19: revolted, e20: defeated, e21: regained, e22: ended, e23: ratified, e24: maintained, e25: continued, e26: domination, e27: dominated, e28: returned, e29: became, e30: war, e31: restarted, e32: leading to, e33: ended, e34: occupied\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The system, first noted as a tropical disturbance on April 17, 1998 east of the Northern Cook Islands, initially moved erratically prior to its designation as Alan upon developing into a tropical cyclone on April 21. The following day, Alan reached its estimated peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained wind speeds of , posing several forecasting challenges due to difficulties in establishing its location and intensity. On April 23, Alan appeared to become sheared with the low-level circulation center displaced about from the nearest atmospheric convection. However, over the next day, after the mid-level trough of low pressure shearing the system moved faster than expected, Alan became better organized. While situated about west-northwest of the French Polynesian island of Tahiti, the system drifted south-southeastward. Early on April 25, Alan passed near to or over the French Polynesian Society Islands of Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. However, strong wind shear pulled the system apart, with visible imagery confirming the system's degeneration into a depression with a fully exposed low-level circulation. The system affected French Polynesia with high winds and torrential rain, causing several landslides on the Society Islands. The landslides resulted in the collapse of two bridges, and also overturned trees, in turn obstructing roads. Overall, ten people died as a result of the system, while thirty others were injured, with a majority of the casualties a result of landslides. On the islands of Raiatea, Taha'a and Huahine, several churches, schools and clinics were damaged, while water and electricity supplies were cut off. On the islands, around 750 houses were destroyed, with 430 and 150 wrecked on Huahine and Ra'iātea, respectively.\nevents: t0: April 17 , 1998, t1: April 21, t2: April 23, t3: the next day, t4: The following day, t5: 10-minute, t6: April 25, e0: disasters, e1: experienced, e2: noted, e3: moved, e4: developing, e5: reached, e6: posing, e7: establishing, e8: appeared, e9: sheared, e10: shearing, e11: moved, e12: organized, e13: situated, e14: drifted, e15: passed, e16: pulled, e17: affected, e18: rain, e19: causing, e20: resulted in, e21: collapse, e22: obstructing, e23: died, e24: injured, e25: casualties, e26: damaged, e27: cut off, e28: destroyed, e29: wrecked\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

It was caused by an approximately near-Earth asteroid with a speed of 19.16 ± 0.15 kilometres per second (60,000–69,000 km/h or 40,000–42,900 mph). It quickly became a brilliant superbolide meteor over the southern Ural region. The light from the meteor was brighter than the Sun, visible up to away. It was observed over a wide area of the region and in neighbouring republics. Some eyewitnesses also felt intense heat from the fireball. Due to its high velocity and shallow angle of atmospheric entry, the object exploded in an air burst over Chelyabinsk Oblast, at a height of around . The explosion generated a bright flash, producing a hot cloud of dust and gas that penetrated to , and many surviving small fragmentary meteorites, as well as a large shock wave. The bulk of the object's energy was absorbed by the atmosphere, with a total kinetic energy before atmospheric impact estimated from infrasound and seismic measurements to be equivalent to the blast yield of 400–500 kilotons of TNT (about 1.4–1.8 PJ) range – 26 to 33 times as much energy as that released from the atomic bomb detonated at Hiroshima. The object was undetected before its atmospheric entry, in part because its radiant was close to the Sun. Its explosion created panic among local residents, and about 1,500 people were injured seriously enough to seek medical treatment. All of the injuries were due to indirect effects rather than the meteor itself, mainly from broken glass from windows that were blown in when the shock wave arrived, minutes after the superbolide's flash. Some 7,200 buildings in six cities across the region were damaged by the explosion's shock wave, and authorities scrambled to help repair the structures in sub-freezing temperatures. With an estimated initial mass of about 12,000–13,000 tonnes (13,000–14,000 short tons, heavier than the Eiffel Tower), and measuring about in diameter, it is the largest known natural object to have entered Earth's atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event, which destroyed a wide, remote, forested, and very sparsely populated area of Siberia. The Chelyabinsk meteor is also the only meteor confirmed to have resulted in a large number of injuries. No deaths were reported.

It was the eighth named storm and the fourth severe tropical storm of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season. The depression formed on July 24. Though it was one of the deadliest tropical storms of 2011, its anticipated landfall was well-publicized and appropriate preparations were made. (cf. :Conson)  Its peak intensity was measured at on the SSHS east of the Philippines. At initial landfall, the storm killed 75, leaving 9 missing, and causing damage around US$65.73 million. The storm exited land and started strengthening again as it moved into the South China Sea. The system turned towards China\'s Island province of Hainan where a yellow alert was issued and heavy to very heavy rainfall was predicted. Fourteen flights from Hainan\'s provincial capital Haikou were cancelled and rail ferry service to China was suspended. Some 27,700 people were evacuated from Hainan\'s low-lying area. Nock-ten claimed 2 lives and caused widespread damage worth US$58 million in Hainan. The system again exited land and strengthened as it curved towards Vietnam. On approaching land, the system and its remnants affected Laos and Thailand. The storm poured extremely heavy rainfall flooding the Yom River and the Nan River. 650,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas as some 6,200 acres of rice and other crop fields were reported completely submerged. Damages were expected to be US$2.33 million and the death toll was put at 42.

It failed when seven transports and one storeship were wrecked and some 850 soldiers drowned in one of the worst naval disasters in British history. The expedition was planned by the administration of Robert Harley, chief minister of the crown, and was based on plans originally proposed in 1708. Harley decided to mount the expedition as part of a major shift in British military policy, emphasizing strength at sea. The expedition\'s leaders, Admiral Hovenden Walker and Brigadier-General John Hill, were chosen for their politics and connections to the crown, and its plans were kept secret even from the Admiralty. Despite the secrecy, French agents were able to discover British intentions and warn authorities in Quebec. The expedition expected to be fully provisioned in Boston, the capital of colonial Massachusetts, but the city was unprepared when it arrived, and Massachusetts authorities had to scramble to provide even three months\' supplies. Admiral Walker also had difficulty acquiring experienced pilots and accurate charts for navigating the waters of the lower Saint Lawrence River. The expedition reached the Gulf of Saint Lawrence without incident, but foggy conditions, tricky currents, and strong winds combined to drive the fleet toward the north shore of the river near a place now called Pointe-aux-Anglais, where the ships were wrecked. Following the disaster, Walker abandoned the expedition\'s objectives and returned to England. Although the expedition was a failure, Harley continued to implement his "blue water" policy.\nevents: t0: 1711, t1: 1708, t2: Queen Anne \'s War, e0: Expedition, e1: attempt, e2: attack, e3: wrecked, e4: drowned, e5: planned, e6: proposed, e7: decided, e8: mount, e9: chosen, e10: kept, e11: discover, e12: warn, e13: provisioned, e14: arrived, e15: provide, e16: acquiring, e17: reached, e18: combined, e19: drive, e20: wrecked, e21: abandoned, e22: returned, e23: implement\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The fourth named storm of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Debbie originated from a well-defined tropical disturbance that was first identified in late August over Central Africa. Tracking generally westward, the system moved off the coast of Senegal on September 5 into the Atlantic Ocean. By this time, it was estimated to have become a tropical storm, but forecasters did not issue advisories on the system until two days later. Late on September 6, Debbie passed through the southern Cape Verde Islands as a strong tropical storm or minimal hurricane, resulting in a plane crash that killed 60 people in the islands. Once clear of the islands, data on the storm became sparse, and the status of Debbie was uncertain over the following several days as it tracked west-northwestward and later northward. It was not until a commercial airliner intercepted the storm on September 10 that its location became certain. The following day, Debbie intensified and reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, with maximum winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). Maintaining its peak intensity for over a day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September 13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the Westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The system passed over the western Azores as a minimal hurricane on September 15. At this point, there is uncertainty as to the structure of Debbie, whether it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone or maintained its identity as a tropical system. Regardless of which took place, the system deepened as it neared Ireland, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September 16. Shortly thereafter, the system was confirmed to have become extratropical as it continued towards the northeast. The remnants of the storm later turned eastward, striking Norway and Russia, before dissipating on September 19. Striking Ireland as a powerful storm, Debbie brought record winds to much of the island, with a peak gust of measured just offshore. These winds caused widespread damage and disruption, downing tens of thousands of trees and power lines. Countless structures sustained varying degrees of damage, with many smaller buildings destroyed. Agriculture experienced extensive losses to barley, corn and wheat crops. Throughout Ireland, Debbie killed 18 people (12 in the Republic of Ireland and six in Northern Ireland). It caused US$40–50 million in damage in the Republic and at least £1.5 million (US$4 million) in Northern Ireland. The storm also battered parts of Great Britain with winds in excess of .\nevents: t0: 1961, t1: September 5, t2: two days later, t3: September 10, t4: September 13, t5: September 15, t6: September 16, t7: September 19, t8: The following day, t9: the following several days, t10: over a day, t11: this time, e0: strike, e1: strike, e2: storm, e3: originated, e4: identified, e5: moved, e6: become, e7: storm, e8: issue, e9: passed, e10: storm, e11: hurricane, e12: resulting in, e13: killed, e14: storm, e15: became, e16: tracked, e17: storm, e18: became, e19: intensified, e20: reached, e21: slowed, e22: weakened, e23: became, e24: influenced, e25: causing, e26: accelerate, e27: passed, e28: hurricane, e29: transitioned, e30: maintained, e31: took place, e32: deepened, e33: confirmed, e34: become, e35: storm, e36: turned, e37: dissipating, e38: Striking, e39: storm, e40: brought, e41: caused, e42: damage, e43: downing, e44: damage, e45: destroyed, e46: experienced, e47: losses, e48: killed, e49: caused, e50: damage, e51: battered\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The attack began on 3 January when Boko Haram overran a military base that was the headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force containing troops from Chad, Niger, and Nigeria. The militants then forced thousands of locals from the region and committed mass killings that culminated on the 7th. Fatalities have been reported to be "heavy" but their extent is unclear. Western media outlets reported that "over 2,000" people are thought to have been killed or "unaccounted for", but local media reported "at least a hundred" fatalities, while the Nigerian Ministry of Defence said that no more than 150 people in total had been killed, including militants. Several government officials denied that the fatalities were as extensive as reported, with some even claiming that the massacre had never taken place or that the Nigerian military had repelled the militants from the region, a claim that was refuted by local officials, survivors, and the international media. Baga and at least 16 other towns are thought to have been destroyed as over 35,000 people are reported to have been displaced, with many feared to have drowned while trying to cross Lake Chad and others trapped on islands in the lake. The attacks are said to have resulted in Boko Haram extending its control to over 70% of Borno State, while its leader, Abubakar Shekau, claimed responsibility for the massacre in a video statement, saying that they "were not much" and that the group\'s insurgency "would not stop".\nevents: t0: 2015, t1: 3 January, t2: 7 January 2015, t3: 3 january, e0: massacre, e1: killings, e2: carried out, e3: attack, e4: began, e5: overran, e6: joint, e7: forced, e8: committed, e9: killings, e10: culminated, e11: Fatalities, e12: reported, e13: reported, e14: killed, e15: reported, e16: fatalities, e17: said, e18: killed, e19: fatalities, e20: reported, e21: claiming, e22: massacre, e23: taken place, e24: repelled, e25: claim, e26: refuted, e27: destroyed, e28: reported, e29: displaced, e30: drowned, e31: attacks, e32: said, e33: resulted in, e34: extending, e35: control, e36: claimed, e37: massacre, e38: statement, e39: saying, e40: stop\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The aircraft, a Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800, crashed into a field approximately north of the Polderbaan runway, (18R), prior to crossing the A9 motorway inbound, at 09:26 UTC (10:26 CET), having flown from Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft broke into three pieces on impact. The wreckage did not catch fire. The crash was caused primarily by the aircraft's automated reaction, which was triggered by a faulty radio altimeter. This caused the autothrottle to decrease the engine power to idle during approach. The crew noticed this too late to take appropriate action to increase the thrust and recover the aircraft before it stalled and crashed.

The festival set what were then records for the loudest amplification system ever installed, the highest paid attendance, and highest gross in history. It was the last of the original wave of rock festivals, as well as one of the most well-executed and financially successful, and presaged the era of media consolidation and the corporatization of the rock music industry.\nevents: t0: April 6 , 1974, e0: festival, e1: held, e2: produced, e3: coordinated, e4: event, e5: booked, e6: campaign, e7: worked, e8: responsible, e9: concert, e10: attracted, e11: paying, e12: festival, e13: set, e14: installed, e15: paid, e16: attendance, e17: festivals\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The aircraft was carrying four B28FI thermonuclear bombs on a Cold War "Chrome Dome" alert mission over Baffin Bay when a cabin fire forced the crew to abandon the aircraft before they could carry out an emergency landing at Thule Air Base. Six crew members ejected safely, but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out. The bomber crashed onto sea ice in North Star Bay, Greenland, causing the conventional explosives aboard to detonate and the nuclear payload to rupture and disperse, which resulted in radioactive contamination. The United States and Denmark launched an intensive clean-up and recovery operation, but the secondary stage of one of the nuclear weapons could not be accounted for after the operation was completed. USAF Strategic Air Command "Chrome Dome" operations were discontinued immediately after the accident, which highlighted the safety and political risks of the missions. Safety procedures were reviewed and more stable explosives were developed for use in nuclear weapons. In 1995, a political scandal resulted in Denmark after a report revealed the government had given tacit permission for nuclear weapons to be located in Greenland, in contravention of Denmark\'s 1957 nuclear-free zone policy. Workers involved in the clean-up program have been campaigning for compensation for radiation-related illnesses they experienced in the years after the accident.\nevents: t0: 21 january 1968, t1: 1995, t2: 1957, t3: the years, e0: accident, e1: occurred, e2: carrying, e3: forced, e4: abandon, e5: carry out, e6: landing, e7: ejected, e8: killed, e9: crashed, e10: causing, e11: detonate, e12: rupture, e13: disperse, e14: resulted in, e15: launched, e16: completed, e17: discontinued, e18: accident, e19: reviewed, e20: developed, e21: resulted in, e22: revealed, e23: given, e24: permission\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The fortifications of Riga consisted of a wall with ditch and 5 bastions around the old town. In 1652 Swedes had started construction of a new wall with 12 bastions around suburbs, but by 1656 the work had not been completed. The Russian vanguard consisting of the Vladimir v. Vizin reiters, Daniel Krafert infantry and Iunkmann dragoons approached Riga on August 20 and threw back the Swedes under count of Pärnu, Heinrich von Thurn into the city. Von Thurn was either killed, or captured in the action. The Swedes evacuated the suburbs and withdrew to the old town. A few days later, the main army under Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich arrived on the ships on the Duna River, and laid siege to Riga. The Russian army occupied three camps, two on the east bank of the Duna in Riga\'s suburbs, and a Corps under Ordyn-Nashokin on the west bank of the Duna, opposite the Kobrun entrenchment. As Russia had no full-fledged navy to intercept reinforcements coming to the Swedish garrison across the Baltic, Riga managed to hold out until October, when foreign officers commanding a small Russian flotilla defected to the other side and the Russians had to lift the siege. In the aftermath of this reverse, the Swedes recaptured much of Ingria, took the Pskov Monastery of the Caves and inflicted a heavy defeat on the Russian general Matvey Sheremetev at Valga in 1657. The events of the siege were recorded in an engraving by Adam Perelli that was first published in 1697 in Samuel Puffendorf\'s work, "Konung Carl X Gustafs Bragder".\nevents: t0: 1652, t1: August 20, t2: A few days later, t3: 1697, t4: 1657, t5: October, t6: 1656, e0: event, e1: started, e2: construction, e3: work, e4: completed, e5: approached, e6: threw, e7: killed, e8: captured, e9: evacuated, e10: withdrew, e11: arrived, e12: siege, e13: occupied, e14: intercept, e15: coming to, e16: managed, e17: hold, e18: commanding, e19: defected, e20: lift, e21: reverse, e22: recaptured, e23: took, e24: inflicted, e25: defeat, e26: siege, e27: recorded, e28: published\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Stirling is located at the crossing of the River Forth, making it a key location for access to the north of Scotland. The castle changed hands several times between English and Scottish control during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357). In 1299, the castle was in English hands, when the constable, John Sampson, was besieged by the Scots. In 1304, Edward I of England besieged the Scots, deploying siege engines to force the garrison to surrender. In 1337, a siege by Sir Andrew Murray failed to retake the castle. Between 1571 and 1585, the castle was besieged three times by Scots factions during the reign of James VI. In 1651, Oliver Cromwell captured the castle during his invasion of Scotland. The final siege took place in 1746, when Charles Edward Stuart besieged the castle during the final Jacobite rising.\nevents: t0: 1299, t1: 1304, t2: 1337, t3: 1651, t4: 1296–1357, t5: 1746, t6: 1571, t7: 1585, e0: sieges, e1: changed, e2: besieged, e3: besieged, e4: deploying, e5: force, e6: surrender, e7: failed, e8: retake, e9: besieged, e10: captured, e11: took place, e12: besieged\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The roots of the Arab–Israeli conflict are attributed to the rise of Zionism and Arab nationalism towards the end of the 19th century, though the two national movements had not clashed until the 1920s. Part of the dispute arised from the conflicting claims to the land. Territory regarded by the Jewish people as their ancestral homeland is at the same time regarded by the Pan-Arab movement as historically and currently belonging to the Arab Palestinians, and in the Pan-Islamic context, as Muslim lands. The sectarian conflict between Palestinian Jews and Arabs emerged in the 1920s, peaking into a full-scale civil war in 1947 and transforming into the First Arab–Israeli War in May 1948, following the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Large-scale hostilities mostly ended with the cease-fire agreements after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Peace agreements were signed between Israel and Egypt in 1979, resulting in Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula and abolishment of the military governance system in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in favor of Israeli Civil Administration and consequent unilateral annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. The nature of the conflict has shifted over the years from the large-scale, regional Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which peaked during the 1982 Lebanon War. With the decline of the First Palestinian Intifada, the interim Oslo Accords led to the creation of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, within the context of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. The same year Israel and Jordan reached a peace accord. A cease-fire has been largely maintained between Israel and Baathist Syria, as well as with Lebanon. Despite the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, interim peace accords with the Palestinian Authority and the generally existing cease-fire, until mid-2010s the Arab League and Israel had remained at odds with each other over many issues. Developments in the course of the Syrian Civil War reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah and the Syrian opposition at odds with each other and complicating their relations with Israel, upon the emerging warfare with Iran. The conflict between Israel and Hamas-ruled Gaza, is also attributed to the Iran–Israel proxy conflict in the region. By 2017, Israel and several Arab Sunni states led by Saudi Arabia, formed a semi-official coalition to confront Iran - a move which some marked as the fading of the Arab-Israeli Conflict.\nevents: t0: 1920s, t1: 1947, t2: 1979, t3: the 1982 Lebanon War, t4: 1994, t5: mid-2010s, t6: 2017, t7: the 20th century, t8: may 1948, t9: The same year, t10: 1920s, e0: conflict, e1: tension, e2: conflicts, e3: disputes, e4: conflict, e5: attributed, e6: rise, e7: movements, e8: clashed, e9: dispute, e10: conflicting, e11: claims, e12: regarded, e13: regarded, e14: conflict, e15: emerged, e16: peaking, e17: war, e18: transforming, e19: war, e20: declaration, e21: independence, e22: ended, e23: War, e24: signed, e25: resulting in, e26: withdrawal, e27: abolishment, e28: annexation, e29: conflict, e30: shifted, e31: peaked, e32: War, e33: decline, e34: led to, e35: creation, e36: reached, e37: accord, e38: cease-fire, e39: maintained, e40: agreements, e41: accords, e42: existing, e43: War, e44: reshuffled, e45: putting, e46: opposition, e47: emerging, e48: warfare, e49: conflict, e50: attributed, e51: conflict, e52: formed, e53: confront, e54: move, e55: marked, e56: fading\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The seventeenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and eighth hurricane of the season, Michael developed from a non-tropical system to the southwest of Bermuda on October 15. The system was initially subtropical, but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by October 17. Michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day. By October 20, Michael peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale at a relatively high latitude of 44°N. The storm weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in Newfoundland on October 20. As the intensity of Michael was equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane during landfall, high winds were reported throughout Atlantic Canada, especially in Newfoundland. Winds from the storm peaked at in St. Lawrence, Newfoundland; other locations across the island reported winds of . High winds caused minor structure damage across Newfoundland, confined to vinyl siding peeled off, shattered windows, and unroofed houses. In addition, sporadic power outages were also reported from Corner Brook to St. John's. Michael also dropped rainfall across Atlantic Canada and in Maine.

For this edition of the Games, four designated hubs will serve as hosts namely Manila, Clark, Subic, and a fourth cluster consisting of venues not grouped with the first three hubs. This will be the fourth time that the Philippines will host the games and its first time since 2005. Previously, it had also hosted the 1981 and 1991 editions of the games. This edition is most notable for being the first edition to include e-sports and obstacle course as well as having the highest number of sports in the history of the games, at 56. The hosting rights were originally awarded to Brunei Darussalam, but the country pulled out days before the 2015 Southeast Asian Games due to "financial and logistical reasons." The Philippines was set to host the games, after Brunei\'s withdrawal. However, the Philippines\' hosting was left uncertain following the withdrawal of government support on July 2017 as it plans to use the funds intended for the games on the rehabilitation of Marawi after being occupied by ISIS supporters. Thailand, Indonesia was willing to step in if no other countries expressed interest to host. Eventually, the Philippines reversed its withdrawal of support and announced that it accepted the hosting of the Games on 16 August 2017. The country\'s hosting of the 30th SEA Games is considered as a stepping stone for its possible bid to host the 2030 Asian Games.\nevents: t0: 30 November, t1: 11 December 2019, t2: 2005, t3: 1981, t4: 1991, t5: July 2017, t6: 16 August 2017, e0: Games, e1: Games, e2: hosted, e3: Games, e4: designated, e5: hosts, e6: host, e7: games, e8: hosted, e9: games, e10: games, e11: hosting, e12: awarded, e13: pulled out, e14: Games, e15: host, e16: games, e17: withdrawal, e18: hosting, e19: withdrawal, e20: support, e21: use, e22: games, e23: occupied, e24: expressed, e25: host, e26: reversed, e27: withdrawal, e28: support, e29: announced, e30: accepted, e31: hosting, e32: Games, e33: hosting, e34: Games, e35: host, e36: Games\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It is one of the biggest annual cultural events of its type in Australia. Every year approximately 125,000 patrons attend the festival. Approximately 2000 performers and 438 events are programmed featuring local, national and international guests. The festival takes place over six days and nights from 27 December to 1 January each year. It features a wide range of performance styles, musical genres and nationalities, with artists playing at over 25 different venues within the festival grounds. Along with musical acts, the festival offers a wide spectrum of entertainment such as circus, cabaret, comedy, street performance, workshops, debate, a Children\'s Festival and more. The streets are lined with restaurants, cafes, stalls, bars, street theatre and parades. The festival supplies both Season and Overnight camping ground to patrons, with most attendees staying for the entire week of festivities. The 3 Minutes Silence is a recurring Woodford tradition, part of the New Year\'s Eve celebrations where festival goers within the grounds gather for 3 minutes of candle-lit silence to welcome the new year. A Sunrise Ceremony then takes place on the Woodfordia hilltop on New Year\'s Day. The whole community greets the Sun as they listen to Tibetan chants and guest musicians on the grassy hill. The final evening of the festival culminates in a spectacular New Year\'s Day closing ceremony, The Fire Event. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Woodford Folk Festival was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an "event and festival".\nevents: t0: 27 December, t1: 1 January, t2: 3 minutes, t3: 2009, e0: held, e1: attend, e2: programmed, e3: featuring, e4: takes place, e5: offers, e6: supplies, e7: gather, e8: takes place, e9: listen, e10: culminates, e11: announced\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The popular movement was remarkable for its avoidance of violence, peaceful approach, and its total reliance on methods of civil resistance. The primary goals of the activists were the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the replacement of a government heavily influenced by Syrian interests with more independent leadership, the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri, the resignation of security officials to ensure the success of the plan, and the organization of free parliamentary elections. The demonstrators demanded the end of the Syrian influence in Lebanese politics. At the start of the demonstrations, Syria had been maintaining a force of roughly 14,000 soldiers and intelligence agents in Lebanon. Following the demonstrations, the Syrian troops completely withdrew from Lebanon on 27 April 2005. With the disbanding of the Pro-Syrian government, the main goals of the revolution were achieved. (For background information on Syria\'s involvement in Lebanese politics, see the articles Syrian occupation of Lebanon and the Lebanese Civil War.)

It began with the February Revolution which was focused around Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), the capital of Russia at that time. It took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War, which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny. In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia\'s parliament, assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government which was heavily dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, resulting in the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II. Grassroots community assemblies called \'Soviets\', which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of Soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the Soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks ("Ones of the Majority") led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions were able to exploit virtually universal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the revolution further. The Bolsheviks turned workers\' militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army) over which they exerted substantial control. The situation climaxed with the October Revolution, a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the Soviets with the capital being relocated to Moscow shortly thereafter. The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the Soviets and, as the now supreme governing party, established a federal government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world\'s first socialist state, practicing Soviet democracy on a national and international scale. The promise to end Russia\'s participation in the First World War was honored promptly with the Bolshevik leaders signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. To further secure the new state, the Cheka was established which functioned as a revolutionary security service that sought to weed out and punish those considered to be "enemies of the people" in campaigns consciously modeled on similar events during the French Revolution. Soon after, civil war erupted among the "Reds" (Bolsheviks), the "Whites" (counter-revolutionaries), the independence movements and other socialist factions opposed to the Bolsheviks. It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists and thereafter reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party. Soviet power was established in the newly independent republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine which led to their unification into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd, there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the state, among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land.\nevents: t0: march 1918, t1: 1922, e0: revolution, e1: revolution, e2: started, e3: concluded, e4: end, e5: began, e6: focused, e7: took place, e8: War, e9: left, e10: control, e11: forming, e12: dominated, e13: felt, e14: suppress, e15: revolution, e16: resulting in, e17: abdication, e18: called, e19: dominated, e20: permitted, e21: insisted, e22: control, e23: ensued, e24: held, e25: led, e26: mutinies, e27: protests, e28: strikes, e29: engaged, e30: vied, e31: campaigned, e32: end, e33: war, e34: chose, e35: fighting, e36: revolution, e37: turned, e38: control, e39: control, e40: overthrew, e41: transferring, e42: relocated, e43: support, e44: established, e45: reorganizing, e46: practicing, e47: promise, e48: signing, e49: established, e50: functioned, e51: punish, e52: revolution, e53: war, e54: erupted, e55: opposed, e56: defeated, e57: reconstituted, e58: established, e59: led to, e60: occurred, e61: took over\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first hung parliament in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first coalition government since the Second World War. The governing Labour administration led by Gordon Brown was defeated in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The opposition Conservatives led by David Cameron won the largest number of seats in the new Parliament, but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming a coalition government. As leader of the third largest party, Clegg had announced that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government as part of a rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown\'s continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal. Although Brown relinquished his role as Labour leader on 10 May, the party failed to reach an agreement with the Liberal Democrats; the latter instead struck a deal with the Conservatives the following day. Brown resigned as Prime Minister on the evening of 11 May, and the Conservative–Liberal Democrat Coalition government led by David Cameron took office shortly thereafter. The Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been "approved overwhelmingly" shortly after midnight on 12 May, and later the same day the two parties published the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement setting out the terms of their deal. While Cameron became Prime Minister, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister.\nevents: t0: 2010, t1: 7 May, t2: 12 May 2010, t3: 2010, t4: 6 May, t5: the Second World War, t6: 36 years, t7: 13 years, t8: the evening of 11 May, t9: the following day, t10: 10 may, t11: shortly, t12: later the same day, t13: 12 May, e0: surrounding, e1: formation, e2: took place, e3: election, e4: produce, e5: election, e6: held, e7: resulted in, e8: sparking, e9: negotiations, e10: form, e11: defeated, e12: election, e13: lost, e14: embarked, e15: meetings, e16: aimed, e17: forming, e18: announced, e19: enter, e20: held, e21: meetings, e22: began, e23: announced, e24: election, e25: negotiations, e26: held, e27: signalled, e28: join, e29: coalition, e30: became, e31: presence, e32: seen, e33: formulating, e34: relinquished, e35: agreement, e36: resigned, e37: took, e38: emerged, e39: meeting, e40: announce, e41: coalition, e42: approved, e43: published, e44: became\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The third named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, it developed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles. It moved briskly west-northwest, passing between the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe. It strengthened to a hurricane in the eastern Caribbean Sea, and it struck Jamaica with winds near Category 3 intensity. It strengthened to a peak intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h) prior to landfall on Quintana Roo, Yucatán Peninsula. It weakened over land, and it re-strengthened over the Gulf of Mexico before it made a final landfall near Tampico. In its path, Charlie caused more than 250 deaths. The hurricane produced Jamaica's deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century, causing more than 152 deaths and $50,000,000 in damages. The hurricane was described as Tampico's worst tropical cyclone since 1936, and it caused more than 100 fatalities in the surrounding areas. Many bodies were not recovered after flooding. The hurricane produced peak gusts of 160 mph (260 km/h) at the airport, and its strongest sustained winds were unmeasured in mainland Mexico, suggesting that it may have been a Category 4 hurricane at landfall.\nevents: t0: 1951, t1: 1936, t2: the 20th century, e0: Hurricane, e1: cyclone, e2: named, e3: storm, e4: hurricane, e5: hurricane, e6: developed, e7: moved, e8: passing, e9: strengthened, e10: hurricane, e11: struck, e12: strengthened, e13: landfall, e14: weakened, e15: re-strengthened, e16: landfall, e17: caused, e18: deaths, e19: hurricane, e20: produced, e21: disaster, e22: causing, e23: deaths, e24: damages, e25: hurricane, e26: described, e27: cyclone, e28: caused, e29: fatalities, e30: recovered, e31: flooding, e32: hurricane, e33: produced, e34: hurricane, e35: landfall\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The city, besieged from October 1936, eventually fell to the Francoist armies on 28 March 1939. Madrid was held by various forces loyal to the Spanish Republic and was besieged and subject to aerial bombardment by the rebel faction under General Francisco Franco. The Battle of Madrid in November 1936 saw the most intense fighting in and around the city when the Nationalists made their most determined attempt to take the Republican capital. The highest military awards of the Spanish Republic, the Laureate Plate of Madrid () and the Madrid Distinction (), established by the Republican government in order to reward courage, were named after the capital of Spain owing to the city symbolizing valour and Antifascist resistance during the long siege throughout the Civil War. Uprising — Madrid held for the Republic (July 1936). The Spanish Civil War began with a failed "coup d\'état" against the Popular Front Government of the Spanish Republic by right-wing Spanish Army officers on 18 July 1936. In Madrid, the Republican government was unsure of what to do. It wanted to put down the coup, but was unsure if it could trust the armed forces and did not want to arm the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade unions and potentially accelerate the ongoing Spanish revolution. On 18 July, the government sent units of the Guardia Civil to Seville to put down the rebellion there. However, on reaching the city the guardias defected to the insurgents. On 19 July Santiago Casares Quiroga resigned as Prime Minister, to be succeeded by Diego Martinez Barrio. He tried to arrange a truce with the insurgent general Emilio Mola by telephone, but Mola refused the offer and Martinez Barrio was ousted as Prime Minister by José Giral. Giral agreed to arm the trade unionists in defence of the Republic, and had 60,000 rifles delivered to the CNT and UGT headquarters, although only 5,000 were in working order. In a radio broadcast on the 18th, the communist leader Dolores Ibarruri coined the famous slogan "¡No pasarán!" ("They shall not pass"), urging resistance against the coup. The slogan was to become synonymous with the defence of Madrid and the Republican cause in general. At the same time, General Joaquín Fanjul, commander of the military garrison based in Montaña barracks in Madrid, was preparing to launch the military rebellion in the city. However, when he tried to march out of the barracks, his 2,500 troops were forced back inside the compound by hostile crowds and armed trade unionists. On the 20th, the barracks was stormed by a mixture of workers and "Guardias de Asalto" ("assault guards", an urban police force) loyal to the government, as well as five battalions of the Communist-led Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias (MAOC) —one of these battalions became the famous "Fifth Regiment"— totaling about 10,000 fighters. The fighting was chaotic, and on several occasions some soldiers within the barracks indicated their willingness to surrender, only for other troops to keep firing at the attackers, killing those who had broken cover to take them prisoner. Eventually the barracks fell when the "Guardias de Asalto" brought up a 75 mm field gun to bombard the complex and its gate was opened by a sapper sergeant sympathetic to the Republican side. The sergeant was killed by one of his officers, but his action allowed the Republicans to breach the walls. A number of soldiers were massacred by the crowd, enraged by the apparent false surrenders, after the fall of the barracks. Thereafter and for the remainder of the war, Madrid was held by the Republicans. However, its population contained a significant number of right-wing sympathisers. Over 20,000 right-wingers sought refuge in foreign embassies in the city. The weeks that followed the July uprising, saw a number of so-called fascists or fascist sympathisers being killed in Madrid by Republicans. For example, on 23 August 70 prisoners from the "Modelo" Prison in the city were massacred in revenge for the Nationalist killing of over 1,500 Republicans after the storming of Badajoz. Nationalist "Drive on Madrid" (August–October 1936). The initial strategy of the military plot had been to assume power all over the country in the manner of a "Pronunciamiento" (military coup) of the 19th century. However, the resistance to the coup by Republicans meant that instead of this, Franco and his allies would have to conquer the country by military force if they wanted to seize power. Franco himself had landed in Algeciras in southern Spain with Moroccan troops from the Spanish Army of Africa. Mola, who was in command of the colonial troops as well as the Spanish Foreign Legion and Carlist and Falangist militia, raised troops in the north. Together, they planned a "Drive on Madrid" to take the Spanish capital, Franco advancing from Badajoz, which he took in August and Mola from Burgos. Franco\'s veteran colonial troops, or "regulares", under General Yague, along with air cover supplied by Nazi Germany, routed the Republican militias in their path. Yague argued for a rapid advance on Madrid, but Franco overruled him in favour of relieving the Nationalist troops besieged in Toledo. This diversion held up their attack on Madrid by up to a month — giving the Republicans time to prepare its defence. Meanwhile, in the city, the Republican government had reformed under the leadership of socialist leader Francisco Largo Caballero. Caballero\'s government included six Socialist party ministers, two Communists, two from the Republican Left party, one from the Catalan Left party, one Basque Nationalist Party and one Republican Union minister. Although the communists were a minority in the government, they gained in influence through their access to arms from the USSR and foreign volunteers in the International Brigades. The Republican military commander in Madrid was nominally a Spanish general, Jose Miaja, but Soviet military personnel were perhaps more important. General Goriev was their overall commander. General Smushkevic controlled the air forces sent from the USSR and General Dmitry Pavlov commanded their armoured forces. Most of the Republican defenders of Madrid (c.90%) were militias, raised by left-wing political parties or trade unions, who elected their own leaders. The Republican command had relatively little control over these units in the early phase of the Civil War. On the other side, both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy supplied Franco with air cover and armoured units for his assault on Madrid, while the Luftwaffe units in Spain, the Condor Legion, were commanded independently of Franco\'s officers. The Nationalists reached Madrid in early November 1936, approaching it from the north along the Corunna Road and west Extremadura road. On 29 October, a Republican counterattack by the 5th (communist) regiment under Enrique Líster was beaten off at Parla. On 2 November, Brunete fell to the nationalists, leaving their troops at the western suburb of Madrid. Mola famously remarked to an English journalist that he would take Madrid with his four columns, of regular and Moroccan troops from southwest in Spain, outside the city and his "Fifth column" - composed of right wing sympathisers within it. The term "fifth column" became a synonym for spies or traitors on the Republican side and paranoia regarding them led to massacre of Nationalist prisoners in Madrid during the ensuing battle. The government including Caballero expected Madrid to fall and so made a pre-planned move from Madrid on 6 November to Valencia. General Miaja and the political leaders who remained formed the "Junta de Defensa de Madrid" (Committee for the Defence of Madrid) to organise the republican defenders. However, the Nationalists\' attempt to capture Madrid had some serious tactical drawbacks. For one thing, their troops were outnumbered over two to one by the defenders (although the Nationalists were far better trained and equipped). Another disadvantage was their inability to surround Madrid and to cut if off from outside help.\nevents: t0: October 1936, t1: 28 March 1939, t2: November 1936, t3: July 1936, t4: 18 July 1936, t5: 18 July, t6: 19 July, t7: 29 October, t8: 2 November, t9: 6 November, t10: 23 August, t11: August, t12: the same time, t13: August–October 1936, t14: 1936, t15: 1939, e0: siege, e1: besieged, e2: fell, e3: held, e4: besieged, e5: bombardment, e6: saw, e7: fighting, e8: take, e9: established, e10: named, e11: held, e12: began, e13: put, e14: arm, e15: accelerate, e16: sent, e17: put, e18: reaching, e19: defected, e20: resigned, e21: arrange, e22: refused, e23: ousted, e24: agreed, e25: defence, e26: delivered, e27: broadcast, e28: coined, e29: pass, e30: urging, e31: become, e32: defence, e33: cause, e34: preparing, e35: launch, e36: march, e37: forced, e38: stormed, e39: became, e40: fighting, e41: indicated, e42: surrender, e43: killing, e44: broken, e45: fell, e46: brought, e47: bombard, e48: opened, e49: killed, e50: allowed, e51: breach, e52: massacred, e53: enraged, e54: held, e55: uprising, e56: saw, e57: killed, e58: massacred, e59: storming, e60: conquer, e61: landed, e62: command, e63: raised, e64: planned, e65: take, e66: advancing, e67: took, e68: supplied, e69: routed, e70: argued, e71: overruled, e72: relieving, e73: besieged, e74: held up, e75: attack, e76: prepare, e77: reformed, e78: gained, e79: access, e80: controlled, e81: sent, e82: commanded, e83: raised, e84: elected, e85: command, e86: control, e87: supplied, e88: commanded, e89: reached, e90: approaching, e91: beaten, e92: fell, e93: leaving, e94: remarked, e95: became, e96: fall, e97: move, e98: remained, e99: formed, e100: organise, e101: capture, e102: outnumbered, e103: trained, e104: equipped, e105: surround, e106: cut, e107: help\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

There were a total of 17 matches played in the men's division and 14 matches played in the women's division. In the men's division a round robin tournament was played with each team playing the other once in order to rank the sides. All five teams then competed in the finals, with Australia eventually defeating New Zealand in the final itself. This win represented their 4th World Cup title in succession and was despite losing their first ever World Cup game to New Zealand in the major semi final. The women's division also featured a round robin tournament, though each of the four sides played each other twice. At the conclusion of the round robin games, the highest ranked side (in this case, Australia) progressed through to the final leaving 2nd and 3rd place (New Zealand and Sri Lanka) to contest the semi final.

The campaign followed directly from the Trafalgar campaign of the year before, in which the French Mediterranean fleet had crossed the Atlantic, returned to Europe and joined with the Spanish fleet. On 21 October 1805, this combined force was destroyed by a British fleet under Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar, although the campaign did not end until the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November 1805. Believing that the French Navy would not be capable of organised resistance at sea during the winter, the First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham withdrew the British blockade squadrons to harbour. Barham had miscalculated – the French Atlantic fleet, based at Brest, had not been involved in the Trafalgar campaign and was therefore at full strength. Taking advantage of the reduction in the British forces off the port, Napoleon ordered two heavy squadrons to sea, under instructions to raid British trade routes while avoiding contact with equivalent Royal Navy forces. Departing from Brest on 13 December 1805, it was 12 days before the Admiralty in London were aware of the French movements, by which time the French squadrons were deep in the Atlantic, one under Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues intending to cruise in the Caribbean and the other, under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, sailing for the South Atlantic. Two British squadrons were hastily mustered and dispatched in pursuit, one under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and the other under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. These squadrons were joined by a third under Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, who had deserted his station off Cadiz when he learned news of a French squadron to his south and subsequently crossed the Atlantic in pursuit of Willaumez. Although Willaumez managed to escape into the South Atlantic, Leissègues was less successful and was discovered and destroyed at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806 by a combined force under Duckworth and Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Other squadrons already at sea became embroiled in the campaign: a smaller squadron that had been raiding the African coast under Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite since August 1805 provided a diversion to the major campaign but failed to draw off significant British forces, while the remnants of a French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois that had been operating in the Indian Ocean since 1803 was intercepted and defeated by Warren in March, after a chance encounter on its journey back to France. Willaumez achieved minor success in his operations in the South Atlantic and Caribbean, but was caught in a summer hurricane on his return journey and his ships were scattered along the Eastern Seaboard of North America. One was intercepted and destroyed by British forces and others were so badly damaged in the storm that they were forced to shelter in American ports. The survivors gradually returned to Brest during the autumn, the last arriving in early 1807. The campaign was the last significant operation in the Atlantic for the remainder of the war, and no French squadron of any size left any of the Biscay ports until 1808. The losses suffered by the Brest fleet weakened it so severely that it would not participate in a major operation until 1809, when an attempt to break out of Brest ended in defeat at the Battle of Basque Roads.\nevents: t0: 1806, t1: 21 october 1805, t2: 4 november 1805, t3: 13 December 1805, t4: 12 days, t5: february 1806, t6: 1803, t7: August 1805, t8: early 1807, t9: 1808, t10: 1809, t11: the Napoleonic Wars, t12: spring, t13: 1806, e0: campaign, e1: conducted, e2: crossed, e3: returned, e4: joined, e5: destroyed, e6: end, e7: Believing, e8: withdrew, e9: miscalculated, e10: based, e11: involved, e12: Taking, e13: ordered, e14: instructions, e15: raid, e16: avoiding, e17: Departing, e18: cruise, e19: sailing, e20: dispatched, e21: joined, e22: deserted, e23: learned, e24: crossed, e25: managed, e26: escape, e27: discovered, e28: destroyed, e29: became, e30: raiding, e31: provided, e32: failed, e33: draw, e34: operating, e35: intercepted, e36: defeated, e37: achieved, e38: caught, e39: return, e40: scattered, e41: intercepted, e42: destroyed, e43: damaged, e44: forced, e45: shelter, e46: returned, e47: arriving, e48: campaign, e49: losses, e50: suffered, e51: weakened, e52: participate, e53: break out, e54: ended\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The Syrian government announced that the army was being sent into the area and were "cleaning" it from rebel fighters, and that the operation would be over in a matter of hours. At this stage, water supplies, electricity and communications were entirely cut off in the Baba Amr district according to opposition activists. Heavy clashes continued throughout the day, as the Syrian Army\'s 4th Armoured Division sent in tanks and infantry. Baba Amr was finally secured by the Syrian army on the morning of 1 March, as rebel forces claimed they had made a "tactical retreat" from the area, after running low on weapons and ammunition.\nevents: t0: 2012, t1: April 14 , 2012, t2: 3 February 2012, t3: 29 February, t4: early February 2012, t5: a matter of hours, t6: the day, e0: offensive, e1: offensive, e2: beginning, e3: ending, e4: offensive, e5: began, e6: attack, e7: killing, e8: began, e9: bombard, e10: blamed, e11: launched, e12: restore, e13: sent, e14: cut off, e15: sent, e16: retreat\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

"Virginius" was a fast American ship hired by Cuban insurrectionists to land men and munitions in Cuba to attack the Spanish regime there. It was captured by the Spanish, who wanted to try the men onboard (many of whom were American and British citizens) as pirates and execute them. The Spanish executed 53 of the men but stopped when the British government demanded it. Throughout the ordeal there was loose talk that the U.S. might declare war on Spain. During the lengthy negotiations the Spanish government had undergone several changes in leadership. US consul Caleb Cushing ended the episode by negotiating $80,000 in reparations to be paid to the families of the Americans who were executed. British families were compensated by the Spanish government through negotiation prior to American compensation. The incident was remarkable for the use of international diplomacy for a peaceful settlement implemented by US Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, rather than opting for a costly war between the United States and Spain. The "Virginius" Affair started a resurgence in the US Navy following the American Civil War; its fleet had been heretofore inferior to the warships of Spain.\nevents: t0: October 1873, t1: February 1875, e0: occurred, e1: hired, e2: attack, e3: captured, e4: stopped, e5: demanded, e6: declare, e7: negotiations, e8: ended, e9: negotiating, e10: paid, e11: compensated, e12: negotiation, e13: implemented, e14: opting, e15: started\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The offensive consisted of a number of joint Coalition and Iraqi Army operations throughout northern Iraq as well as in the southern Baghdad Belts. The northern operation was designated Operation Iron Harvest. Its objective was to hunt down the remaining 200 Al-Qaeda extremists remaining in the province of Diyala following the end of the previous offensive. The operation also included targeting insurgent elements in Salah ad-Din province and Nineveh province. The southern operation was designated Operation Marne Thunderbolt and targeted insurgent safe havens in the belts to the south-east of Baghdad, particularly the Arab Jabour region.

They originated in long-standing disputes over control and governance of the Church of Scotland or kirk that went back to the 1580s. These came to a head in 1637 when Charles I attempted to impose uniform practices between the kirk and the Church of England. Charles favoured an episcopal system, or rule by bishops, while the majority of Scots advocated a presbyterian system, without bishops. The 1638 National Covenant pledged to oppose these 'innovations' and the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland voted to expel bishops from the kirk. When Charles resorted to force, the Covenanters defeated Royalist forces in Aberdeenshire in 1639, then an English army in 1640, leaving them in control of Scotland.\nevents: t0: 1639, t1: 1640, t2: 1639–1652, t3: the 1580s, t4: 1637, t5: 1638, t6: 1639, t7: 1640, e0: Wars, e1: viewed, e2: Wars, e3: involved, e4: originated, e5: disputes, e6: control, e7: governance, e8: came to, e9: impose, e10: favoured, e11: advocated, e12: pledged, e13: oppose, e14: assembly, e15: voted, e16: expel, e17: defeated, e18: leaving, e19: control\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The air strikes lasted from March 24, 1999 to June 10, 1999. The official NATO operation code name was "Operation Allied Force"; the United States called it "Operation Noble Anvil", while in Yugoslavia, the operation was incorrectly called "Merciful Angel" ( / "Milosrdni anđeo"), as a result of a misunderstanding or mistranslation. The bombings continued until an agreement was reached that led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav armed forces from Kosovo, and the establishment of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), a UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries, and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations and agencies, such as the United Nations, NATO, and INGOs. NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the United Nations Security Council for military action, but were opposed by China and Russia that indicated they would veto such a proposal. NATO launched a campaign without UN authorisation, which it described as a humanitarian intervention. The FRY described the NATO campaign as an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign country that was in violation of international law because it did not have UN Security Council support. The bombing killed between 489 and 528 civilians, and destroyed bridges, industrial plants, public buildings, private businesses, as well as barracks and military installations. In the days after the Yugoslav army withdrew, over 164,000 Serbs and 24,000 Roma left Kosovo and many of the remaining non-Albanian civilians (as well as Albanians perceived as collaborators) were victims of abuse which included beatings, abductions and murders. After Kosovo and other Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and IDPs (including Kosovo Serbs) in Europe. The NATO bombing marked the second major combat operation in its history, following the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The crash resulted in the deaths of all twenty-five passengers and four crew on board. Among the passengers were almost all the United Kingdom\'s senior Northern Ireland intelligence experts. The accident is the RAF\'s worst peacetime disaster. In 1995, an RAF board of inquiry ruled that it was impossible to establish the exact cause of the accident. This ruling was subsequently overturned by two senior reviewing officers, who stated the pilots were guilty of gross negligence for flying too fast and too low in thick fog. This finding proved to be controversial, especially in light of irregularities and technical issues surrounding the then-new Chinook HC.2 variant which were uncovered. A Parliamentary inquiry conducted in 2001 found the previous verdict of gross negligence on the part of the crew to be \'unjustified\'.

It was the sixth named storm and second typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season. Originating from an area of low pressure near Wake Island on July 9, the precursor to Ma-on gradually developed as it moved westward. By July 11, it had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression, although the cyclone's circulation remained broad. Over the following days, Ma-on gradually intensified and attained typhoon status on July 14. Favorable environmental conditions allowed for additional strengthening, and the storm ultimately attained peak ten-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on July 16. After turning northward in response to a weakening subtropical ridge, the typhoon underwent a series of eyewall replacement cycles that caused it to weaken. On July 19, Ma-on struck Shikoku before turning southeastward and moving back over water. Slow weakening continued as Ma-on succumbed to the effects of high wind shear. The system ultimately became extratropical on July 24, and was last noted by the Japan Meteorological Agency a week later near the Kamchatka Peninsula. Initially, Ma-on posed a slight threat to the Mariana Islands and prompted the issuance of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained far away from the area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200 mm (48 in), led to widespread and damaging floods. Five people perished as a result of Ma-on, and damage reached ¥3.9 billion (2011 JPY, $50 million 2011 USD).\nevents: t0: July 2011, t1: July 9, t2: July 11, t3: july 14, t4: July 16, t5: ten-minute, t6: July 19, t7: July 24, t8: a week later, e0: known, e1: affected, e2: developed, e3: moved, e4: become, e5: organized, e6: declared, e7: remained, e8: intensified, e9: attained, e10: allowed, e11: strengthening, e12: storm, e13: attained, e14: turning, e15: response, e16: weakening, e17: caused, e18: weaken, e19: struck, e20: turning, e21: moving back, e22: weakening, e23: succumbed, e24: became, e25: posed, e26: prompted, e27: issuance, e28: warnings, e29: remained, e30: evacuated, e31: storm, e32: led to, e33: perished, e34: damage\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Two members of British intelligence obtained the body of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison, dressed him as an officer of the Royal Marines and placed personal items on him identifying him as the fictitious Captain (Acting Major) William Martin. Correspondence between two British generals which suggested that the Allies planned to invade Greece and Sardinia, with Sicily as merely the target of a feint, was also placed on the body. Part of the wider Operation Barclay, Mincemeat was based on the 1939 Trout memo, written by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division and his personal assistant, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill and the military commander in the Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the plan began by transporting the body to the southern coast of Spain by submarine and releasing it close to shore, where it was picked up the following morning by a Spanish fisherman. The nominally neutral Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had been read and Ultra decrypts of German messages showed that the Germans fell for the ruse. Reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia before and during the invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none. The effect of Operation Mincemeat is unknown, although Sicily was liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in "Operation Heartbreak", a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, before one of the agents who planned and carried out Mincemeat, Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953. Montagu\'s work formed the basis for the 1956 British film "The Man Who Never Was".\nevents: t0: 1939, t1: 1950, t2: 1953, t3: 1956, e0: obtained, e1: died, e2: eating, e3: dressed, e4: placed, e5: identifying, e6: suggested, e7: planned, e8: placed, e9: approval, e10: began, e11: transporting, e12: picked up, e13: shared, e14: examination, e15: showed, e16: showed, e17: shifted, e18: invasion, e19: received, e20: losses, e21: depicted, e22: planned, e23: carried out, e24: wrote, e25: formed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The school bus, driven by a substitute driver, was stopped at a traffic light with the rearmost portion extending onto a portion of the railroad tracks when it was struck by a Metra Union Pacific / Northwest Line train en route to Chicago. The crash involved a signalled rail crossing located very near a highway intersection which was regulated by traffic signals. The devices were connected and operations were supposed to be carefully timed and coordinated. Such locations are known as "interconnected crossings" within the industries. Highway and railroad officials had each received numerous complaints from the public about the insufficient timing of the warnings provided by the signals in the year prior to the crash, and citizens later told of situations with vehicles unable to clear the tracks in a timely manner. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that, while the bus driver was not aware that a portion of the bus was on the tracks as she should have been, the timing of signals was so insufficient that, even if she had identified the hazard as the train approached, she would have had to proceed against a red traffic signal into the highway intersection to have moved out of the train\'s path. Legislation and re-engineering of interconnected crossings across the state of Illinois combined with greater awareness elsewhere resulted in efforts to help to prevent similar crashes from recurring. Informational decals were also added to Illinois school buses advising drivers of the length of each bus, since the substitute school bus driver was apparently unaware of the exact length of the bus she was driving. Other states have also embraced that and related aspects and incorporated them into their school bus driver training curriculum. The Fox River Grove crash stands as the worst crash involving a Metra train in its history, and one of the worst grade crossing crashes in U.S. history. At the crash site, the improved signaling system installed after the crash now protects the passing trains and motor vehicle traffic.

It took place in July 1917. It was decided by Alexander Kerensky, Minister of War in the Russian provisional government, and led by General Brusilov. Such a decision was ill-timed, because, following the February Revolution, there were strong popular demands for peace, especially within the Russian Army, whose fighting capabilities were quickly deteriorating. Discipline within the Russian Army had reached a point of crisis since the Tsar\'s abdication. The Petrograd Soviet\'s "Order Number 1" tremendously weakened the power of officers, giving an over-riding mandate to "soldier committees". The abolition of the death penalty was another contributing factor, as was the high presence of revolutionary agitators at the front including Bolshevik agitators, who promoted a defeatist agenda (and whom Kerensky tolerated considerably more than conservative agitators). Riots and mutineering at the front became common, officers were often the victims of soldier harassment and even murder. Furthermore, the policy of the new government towards the war effort was one of fulfilling obligations towards Russia\'s allies, as opposed to fighting for the sake of total victory, thus giving soldiers a less credible motivation to fight. However, Kerensky hoped that an important Russian victory would gain popular favour and restore the soldiers\' morale, thus strengthening the weak provisional government and proving the effectiveness of "the most democratic army in the world", as he referred to it. Starting on July 1, 1917 the Russian troops attacked the Austro-Germans in Galicia, pushing toward Lviv. The operations involved the Russian 11th, 7th and 8th Armies and the Austro-German South Army (General von Bothmer) and the Austrian 7th and 3rd Armies. After an initial success, the offensive was halted because the Russian soldiers soon mutinied and refused to fight. It collapsed altogether by July 16. On the 18th the Austro-Germans counterattacked, meeting little resistance and advancing through Galicia and Ukraine until the Zbruch River. The Russian lines were broken on the 20th, and by the 23rd, the Russians had retreated about 240 kilometres (150 miles). The Russian provisional government was greatly weakened by this military catastrophe, and the possibility of a Bolshevik coup d\'état became increasingly real. Far from strengthening Russian army morale, this offensive proved that Russian army morale no longer existed. No Russian general could now count on the soldiers under his command actually doing what they were ordered to do. This offensive also helped the start of the July Days. One last fight took place between the Germans and the Russians in this war. On September 1, 1917 the Germans attacked and captured Riga. The Russian soldiers defending the town refused to fight and fled from the advancing German troops.\nevents: t0: July 1917, t1: July 1 , 1917, t2: July 16, t3: September 1 , 1917, t4: World War I, e0: took place, e1: decided, e2: led, e3: Revolution, e4: demands, e5: fighting, e6: reached, e7: crisis, e8: abdication, e9: weakened, e10: giving, e11: death, e12: contributing, e13: promoted, e14: became, e15: murder, e16: fulfilling, e17: opposed, e18: fighting, e19: giving, e20: fight, e21: gain, e22: restore, e23: strengthening, e24: referred, e25: Starting, e26: attacked, e27: pushing, e28: involved, e29: halted, e30: mutinied, e31: refused, e32: fight, e33: collapsed, e34: counterattacked, e35: meeting, e36: advancing, e37: broken, e38: retreated, e39: weakened, e40: became, e41: strengthening, e42: proved, e43: existed, e44: count on, e45: command, e46: ordered, e47: helped, e48: start, e49: fight, e50: took place, e51: attacked, e52: captured, e53: defending, e54: refused, e55: fight, e56: fled\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Piérola\'s supporters used the Peruvian monitor "Huáscar" as a raiding ship. She harassed the shipping especially off El Callao, the main commercial port of Peru. However, after she boarded some British merchant ships, British authorities sent Rear Admiral de Horsey to capture the vessel. The Peruvian warship managed to outrun the British squadron after a fierce exchange of fire. "Huáscar"s guns were undermanned, and she fired just 40 rounds. "Shah"s mast was damaged by splinters. On the British side, "Shah" fired 237 shots and "Amethyst" 190, but none of them carried armour-piercing ammunition. "Huáscar" was hit 60 times, but her armour shield defeated all the rounds. There was a last-ditch effort to stop or sink the rebels when two small torpedo rams from "Shah" attempted to find the "Huáscar", but the Peruvian ship managed to escape under the cover of darkness. The rebel crew was forced to surrender their ship to the Peruvian government just two days later. This battle saw the first use of the newly invented self-propelled torpedo which, at the time, had just entered limited service with the Royal Navy.

Electric Picnic differs from other festivals in Ireland in that the music choice is more eclectic than the other mainstream events (its history includes international acts such as Kraftwerk, Röyksopp, Nick Cave, Sonic Youth, New Order, Björk, Arcade Fire, Beastie Boys, The Stooges, The Chemical Brothers, Gary Numan, The Flaming Lips, Sigur Rós and Sex Pistols), and there is more emphasis on quality festival services (such as food and sleeping arrangements) and a generally more positive and relaxed atmosphere. There is also an emphasis on eco-friendly initiatives. Electric Picnic began as a one-day event in 2004, before growing to a weekend-long festival within a year. The festival incorporates attractions such as the 24-hour cinema tent, the Body and Soul arena (offering an ambient lounge with beanbags, massages and tarot card readings) and the Comedy Tent (curated by Gerry Mallon) and a silent disco. In 2008, Amnesty International attended the festival to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whilst renowned American Burning Man artist, David Best constructed a Temple of Truth on site. Electric Picnic has been described as an "enormously successful, award-winning, established brand" which "attempts to bring to life a microcosmic cultural experience where music is just the tip of the iceberg".\nevents: t0: 2009, t1: 2010, t2: 2007, t3: 2008, t4: 2004, t5: weekend-long, t6: a year, t7: 24-hour, t8: 2008, t9: 2004, e0: festival, e1: organised, e2: voted, e3: voted, e4: began, e5: described, e6: calling, e7: describing, e8: described, e9: differs, e10: began, e11: growing, e12: festival, e13: incorporates, e14: offering, e15: festival, e16: celebrate, e17: described, e18: bring\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Dot originated from a small area of thunderstorm activity in early to mid October. The system was first classified on October 11, and steadily intensified over the next few days. Dot attained typhoon strength on October 15, and subsequently entered a period of explosive deepening, which was not anticipated by forecasters. The next day the intensification rate slowed, but that evening, Dot attained its maximum intensify. A steady weakening trend began on October 17, though the system maintained typhoon intensity through the passage of the Philippines. After entering the South China Sea late on October 18, Dot briefly re-intensified, only to weaken as it approached Vietnam. On October 21, Dot struck Vietnam while still a typhoon, but dissipated the next day over the high terrain of the nation. Although damage across the Philippines was less than initially expected, the typhoon lashed the nation with heavy rains. Province of Nueva Ecija suffered the worst effects from Dot. There, of crops and 90% of all buildings were damaged. In Cabanatuan, 2,500 homes and 90% of structures were destroyed. Overall, 42 towns were flooded, forcing a total of 125,000 people to flee their homes, 35,000 of which were homeless. Furthermore, 52,933 houses were leveled while an additional 200,450 were damaged. Nationwide, 24 were hurt. While tracking through the South China Sea, Dot passed through Hainan Island. There, two casualties occurred while 34 others suffered injuries. Across the island, over 2,300 dwellings were destroyed. In all, Dot was responsible for 90 deaths and $104.9 million (1985 USD) in damage.\nevents: t0: 1985, t1: October 11, t2: October 15, t3: The next day, t4: October 17, t5: October 18, t6: October 21, t7: the next day, t8: mid October, t9: the next few days, e0: storm, e1: originated, e2: intensified, e3: attained, e4: entered, e5: slowed, e6: attained, e7: began, e8: maintained, e9: entering, e10: re-intensified, e11: weaken, e12: approached, e13: struck, e14: dissipated, e15: damage, e16: suffered, e17: effects, e18: damaged, e19: destroyed, e20: flooded, e21: forcing, e22: flee, e23: leveled, e24: damaged, e25: hurt, e26: tracking, e27: passed, e28: occurred, e29: suffered, e30: injuries, e31: destroyed, e32: deaths, e33: damage\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The battle was the culmination of Philip\'s final campaigns in 339-338 BC and resulted in a decisive victory for the Macedonians. Philip had brought peace to a war-torn Greece in 346 BC, by ending the Third Sacred War, and concluding his ten-year conflict with Athens for supremacy in the north Aegean, by making a separate peace. Philip\'s much expanded kingdom, powerful army and plentiful resources now made him the "de facto" leader of Greece. To many of the fiercely independent city-states, Philip\'s power after 346 BC was perceived as a threat, especially in Athens, where the politician Demosthenes led efforts to break away from Philip\'s influence. In 340 BC Demosthenes convinced the Athenian assembly to sanction action against Philip\'s territories and to ally with the Achaemenids in Byzantium, which Philip was besieging. These actions were against the terms of their treaty oaths and amounted to a declaration of war. In summer 339 BC, Philip therefore led his army towards South Greece, prompting the formation of an alliance of a few southern Greek states opposed to him, led by Athens and Thebes. After several months of stalemate, Philip finally advanced into Boeotia in an attempt to march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout. The battle has been described as one of the most decisive of the ancient world. The forces of Athens and Thebes were destroyed, and continued resistance was impossible; the war therefore came to an abrupt end. Philip was able to impose a settlement upon southern Greece, which all states accepted, with the exception of Sparta. The League of Corinth, formed as a result, made all participants allies of Macedon and each other, with Philip as the guarantor of the peace. In turn, Philip was voted as "strategos" (general) for a pan-Hellenic war against the Achaemenid Empire, which he had long planned. However, before he was able to take charge of the campaign, Philip was assassinated, and the Kingdom of Macedon and responsibility for the war with Persia passed instead to his son Alexander.\nevents: t0: 338 BC, t1: 339-338 BC, t2: 346 BC, t3: 346 BC, t4: 340 BC, t5: 339 BC, t6: ten-year, t7: several months, e0: Battle, e1: fought, e2: battle, e3: campaigns, e4: resulted in, e5: victory, e6: brought, e7: ending, e8: War, e9: concluding, e10: conflict, e11: making, e12: expanded, e13: made, e14: break, e15: influence, e16: convinced, e17: sanction, e18: besieging, e19: amounted, e20: declaration, e21: war, e22: prompting, e23: formation, e24: opposed, e25: advanced, e26: march, e27: Opposing, e28: blocking, e29: occupying, e30: battle, e31: fight, e32: crushed, e33: dissolved, e34: rout, e35: battle, e36: described, e37: destroyed, e38: resistance, e39: war, e40: end, e41: impose, e42: settlement, e43: accepted, e44: formed, e45: voted, e46: war, e47: planned, e48: campaign, e49: assassinated, e50: war, e51: passed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The Afghan government accused the Taliban of seeking shelter near the wedding party. On 7 November 2008, Afghan officials said a joint investigation found that 37 civilians and 26 insurgents were killed in Wech Baghtu. Wedding parties in Afghanistan are segregated by sex; of the civilians, 23 were children, 10 were women, and 4 were men. Another 27 persons were injured, including the bride. The bombing destroyed the housing complex where women and children had gathered to celebrate.

The first workers strike, in West Virginia, was the Cabin Creek and Paint Creek strike of 1912-1913. With help from Mary "Mother Jones" Harris Jones, an important figure in unionizing the mine workers, the miners demanded better pay, better work conditions, the right to trade where they pleased (ending the practice of forcing miners to buy from company-owned stores), and recognition of the United Mine Workers (UMW). The mining companies refused to meet the demands of the workers and instead hired Baldwin-Felts agents equipped with high-powered rifles to guard the mines and act as strikebreakers. After the Agents arrived, the miners either moved out or were evicted from the houses they had been renting from the coal companies, and moved into coal camps that were being supported by the Union. Approximately 35,000 people lived in these coal camps. A month after the strike began, hostilities began with the arrival of the Baldwin-Felts Agents who provoked the miners. Socialist Party activists began supplying miners with weapons: 6 machine guns, 1,000 high-powered rifles, and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. On September 1, 1912, approximately 6,000 unionized miners from across the Kanawha River crossed the river and declared their intent to kill the mine guards and destroy the company operations. Due to this threat, the mining companies deployed additional armed guards and awaited the miners\' attack. Consequently, the Governor proclaimed martial law to be in effect on September 2, 1912, seizing 1,872 high-powered rifles, 556 pistols, 6 machine guns, 225,000 rounds of ammunition, and 480 blackjacks - as well as large quantities of daggers, bayonets, and brass knuckles. On May 19, 1920, a shootout in Matewan, West Virginia, between agents of the Baldwin-Felts and local miners, who later joined the United Mine Workers of America, sparked what became known as the Battle of Blair Mountain, the largest insurrection in the United States since the American Civil War.\nevents: t0: 1912–21, t1: 1912-1913, t2: September 1 , 1912, t3: September 2 , 1912, t4: May 19 , 1920, t5: the American Civil War, e0: wars, e1: wars, e2: arose, e3: dispute, e4: strike, e5: help, e6: demanded, e7: practice, e8: forcing, e9: refused, e10: demands, e11: hired, e12: equipped, e13: guard, e14: arrived, e15: moved, e16: evicted, e17: renting, e18: moved, e19: supported, e20: began, e21: began, e22: provoked, e23: began, e24: supplying, e25: crossed, e26: declared, e27: kill, e28: destroy, e29: threat, e30: deployed, e31: proclaimed, e32: seizing, e33: shootout, e34: joined, e35: sparked\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It developed in the Gulf of Mexico on the same day as the September 11 attacks; after the attacks, flights were canceled nationwide for two days, and when Gabrielle struck Florida on September 14, it caused a day of additional cancellations. The storm moved ashore with winds of near Venice, a city located south of the Tampa Bay area. The combination of the winds and heavy rainfall, which peaked at in Parrish, left 570,000 customers without power along the west coast and 126,000 customers without power on the east coast. The storm caused about $230 million (2001 USD) in damage in Florida. In the Gulf of Mexico, high waves contributed to two deaths, one of which was indirect; there was also a death due to flooding in Winter Haven. After crossing the state, Gabrielle had the appearance of an occluded frontal low or subtropical cyclone; this was after the convection decreased near the center. However, Gabrielle gradually re-intensified and became a hurricane on September 17 as it passed northwest of Bermuda. The hurricane reached peak winds of , but weakened subsequently due to wind shear. Gabrielle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 19, and later that day it passed just southeast of Newfoundland. The storm produced record rainfall that caused what was described the "worst flooding in 100 years" in St. John\'s. Several roads and houses were flooded in the region. The extratropical remnants of Gabrielle continued to the northeast and dissipated on September 21.\nevents: t0: September of 2001, t1: September 11, t2: September 14, t3: September 17, t4: September 19, t5: September 21, t6: two days, t7: 100 years, e0: hurricane, e1: caused, e2: flooding, e3: developed, e4: attacks, e5: canceled, e6: struck, e7: caused, e8: cancellations, e9: moved, e10: combination, e11: left, e12: caused, e13: damage, e14: contributed, e15: deaths, e16: death, e17: flooding, e18: crossing, e19: appearance, e20: cyclone, e21: decreased, e22: re-intensified, e23: became, e24: hurricane, e25: passed, e26: reached, e27: weakened, e28: transitioned, e29: cyclone, e30: passed, e31: caused, e32: described, e33: flooding, e34: flooded, e35: dissipated\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The events, which began on 5 May 2010, were provoked by plans to cut public spending and raise taxes as austerity measures in exchange for a bail-out, aimed at solving the Greek government-debt crisis. Three people were killed on 5 May in one of the largest demonstrations in Greece since 1973. On , anti-austerity activists organised by the Direct Democracy Now! movement, known as the Indignant Citizens Movement (, "Kínima Aganaktisménon-Politón"), started demonstrating in major cities across Greece. This second wave of demonstrations proved different from the years before in that they were not partisan and began through peaceful means. Some of the events later turned violent, particularly in the capital city of Athens. Inspired by the anti-austerity protests in Spain, these demonstrations were organised entirely using social networking sites, which earned it the nickname "May of Facebook". The demonstrations and square sit-ins were officially ended when municipal police removed demonstrators from Thessaloniki\'s White Tower square on 7 August 2011. On 29 June 2011, violent clashes occurred between the riot police and activists as the Greek parliament voted to accept the EU\'s austerity requirements. Incidents of police brutality were reported by international media such as the BBC, "The Guardian", CNN iReport and "The New York Times", as well as by academic research and organisations Amnesty International.

The rebellion, which took place on 18 August 1823 and lasted for two days, was led by slaves with the highest status. In part they were reacting to poor treatment and a desire for freedom; in addition, there was a widespread, mistaken belief that Parliament had passed a law for emancipation, but it was being withheld by the colonial rulers. Instigated chiefly by Jack Gladstone, a slave at "Success" plantation, the rebellion also involved his father, Quamina, and other senior members of their church group. Its English pastor, John Smith, was implicated. The largely non-violent rebellion was brutally crushed by the colonists under governor John Murray. They killed many slaves: estimates of the toll from fighting range from 100 to 250. After the insurrection was put down, the government sentenced another 45 men to death, and 27 were executed. The executed slaves\' bodies were displayed in public for months afterwards as a deterrent to others. Jack was deported to the island of Saint Lucia after the rebellion following a clemency plea by Sir John Gladstone, the owner of "Success" plantation. John Smith, who had been court-martialed and was awaiting news of his appeal against a death sentence, died a martyr for the abolitionist cause. News of Smith\'s death strengthened the abolitionist movement in Britain. Quamina, who is thought to have been the actual leader of the rebellion, was declared a national hero after Guyana\'s independence.

Order was restored with many of the Afghans hiding throughout the city being dragged through the streets and massacred without mercy in reprisals. The tomb of Mahmud Hotaki was also another target of the mob\'s rage, being demolished and later becoming home to a public toilet. Tahmasp II regains the Safavid capital. On December 9, 1729 Nader awaited outside the city gates for the Shah\'s arrival. Tahmasp was received in a ceremony in which as soon as he reached Nader\'s person he "dismounted from his horse in a show of respect whence Nader did likewise rushing forth to dissuade the Shah from his magnanimous deed, however the Shah insisted they walk together and expressed an inability to reward Nader\'s ceaseless service to him. After a few more minutes of polite conversation the Shah remounted his steed and led the way back into the city with Nader following close behind".

Its aim was to prevent the destruction of German civilians, military and civil industries by the Western Allies. The day and night air battles over Germany during the war involved thousands of aircraft, units and aerial engagements to counter the Allied strategic bombing campaign. The campaign was one of the longest in the history of aerial warfare and with the Battle of the Atlantic and the Allied Blockade of Germany was the longest of the war. The "Luftwaffe" fighter force defended the airspace of German-occupied territory against attack, first by RAF Bomber Command and then against the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). In the early years, the "Luftwaffe" was able to inflict a string of defeats on Allied strategic air forces. In 1939, Bomber Command was forced to operate at night, due to the extent of losses of unescorted heavy bombers flying in daylight. In 1943, the USAAF suffered several reverses in daylight and called off the offensive over Germany in October. The British built up their bomber force and introduced navigational aids and tactics such as the bomber stream that enabled them to mount larger and larger attacks with an acceptable loss rate. However, the USAAF introduced the P-51 Mustang, a fighter capable of escorting the USAAF bombers to and from their targets in daylight. With new fighter tactics, the Eighth Air Force gained air supremacy over Nazi Germany by the spring of 1944 against the "Luftwaffe". American strategic bombing raids in June-July 1944 seriously damaged twenty-four synthetic oil plants and sixty-nine refineries, which brought 98% of all of Germany’s aviation fuel plants to halt and dropped monthly synthetic oil production to 51,000 tons. After these attacks, recovery efforts in the following month could only bring back 65% of aviation fuel production temporarily. In the first quarter of 1944, Nazi Germany produced 546,000 tons of aviation fuel, with 503,000 tons came from synthetic fuel by hydrogenation. Aviation fuel stock reserves had since dropped by 70% in April 1944, to 370,000 tons in June 1944, and to 175,000 tons in November. Chronic fuel shortages, severe curtailment of flying training and further accelerated deterioration in pilot quality steadily decreased the "Luftwaffe"s effective fighting capabilities in the last months. By the end of the campaign, American forces claimed to have destroyed 35,783 enemy aircraft and the RAF claimed 21,622, for a total of 57,405 German aircraft claimed destroyed. The USAAF dropped 1.46 million tons of bombs on Axis-occupied Europe while the RAF dropped 1.31 million tons, for a total of 2.77 million tons, of which 51.1 percent was dropped on Germany. In addition to the direct damages incurred by Germany\'s industry and air force, the Wehrmacht was forced to use millions of men, thousands of artillery pieces, and hundreds of millions of shells in a desperate attempt to halt American-British Combined Bomber Offensive. From January 1942 to April 1943, German arms industry grew by an average of 5.5% monthly, and by summer 1943, the systematic attack against German industry by Allied bombers, brought the overall armament production — during the period of May 1943 to March 1944 — to a complete halt. At the ministerial meeting in January 1945, Albert Speer noted that, since the intensification of the bombing began, 35 percent fewer tanks, 31 percent fewer aircraft and 42 percent fewer lorries were produced as planned and as a direct result of the bombing. The German economy had to switch vast amount of resources away from equipment for the fighting fronts and assign them instead to combat the bombing threat. The intensification of night bombing by the RAF and daylight attacks by the USAAF added to the destruction of a major part of the German\'s industries and cities, which caused the economy to collapse in the winter of 1944–45. By this time, the Allied armies had reached the German border and the strategic campaign became fused with the tactical battles over the front. The air campaign continued until April 1945, when the last strategic bombing missions were flown and it ended upon the capitulation of Germany on 8 May.\nevents: t0: 1939, t1: 1943, t2: June-July 1944, t3: 1944, t4: November, t5: June 1944, t6: April 1944, t7: the last months, t8: April 1943, t9: January 1942, t10: March 1944, t11: May 1943, t12: January 1945, t13: 1944–45, t14: 8 May, t15: World War II, t16: April 1945, t17: summer 1943, e0: given, e1: defensive, e2: campaign, e3: fought, e4: aim, e5: prevent, e6: destruction, e7: battles, e8: war, e9: involved, e10: counter, e11: bombing, e12: warfare, e13: Battle, e14: defended, e15: attack, e16: command, e17: inflict, e18: defeats, e19: forced, e20: operate, e21: due, e22: losses, e23: flying, e24: suffered, e25: called, e26: built, e27: introduced, e28: enabled, e29: mount, e30: attacks, e31: loss, e32: introduced, e33: escorting, e34: gained, e35: bombing, e36: raids, e37: damaged, e38: brought, e39: halt, e40: dropped, e41: attacks, e42: bring, e43: produced, e44: dropped, e45: flying, e46: training, e47: decreased, e48: fighting, e49: claimed, e50: destroyed, e51: claimed, e52: claimed, e53: destroyed, e54: dropped, e55: dropped, e56: dropped, e57: damages, e58: forced, e59: use, e60: halt, e61: grew, e62: attack, e63: brought, e64: production, e65: halt, e66: meeting, e67: noted, e68: bombing, e69: began, e70: produced, e71: planned, e72: result, e73: bombing, e74: switch, e75: fighting, e76: assign, e77: combat, e78: bombing, e79: bombing, e80: attacks, e81: added, e82: destruction, e83: caused, e84: collapse, e85: reached, e86: became, e87: fused, e88: continued, e89: bombing, e90: ended\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in Normandy, but the lack of available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August. The goal of the invasion was to secure the vital ports on the French Mediterranean coast and increase pressure on the German forces by opening another front. After some preliminary commando operations, the US VI Corps landed on the beaches of the Côte d\'Azur under the shield of a large naval task force, followed by several divisions of the French Army B. They were opposed by the scattered forces of the German Army Group G, which had been weakened by the relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate "Ostlegionen" outfitted with obsolete equipment. Hindered by total Allied air superiority and a large-scale uprising by the French Resistance, the weak German forces were swiftly defeated. The Germans withdrew to the north through the Rhône valley, to establish a stable defense line at Dijon. Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Montélimar. The ensuing battle led to a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough, until the Germans were finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from the town. While the Germans were retreating, the French managed to capture the important ports of Marseille and Toulon, putting them into operation soon after. The Germans were not able to hold Dijon and ordered a complete withdrawal from Southern France. Army GroupG retreated further north, pursued by Allied forces. The fighting ultimately came to a stop at the Vosges mountains, where Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line. After meeting with the Allied units from Operation Overlord, the Allied forces were in need of reorganizing and, facing stiffened German resistance, the offensive was halted on 14September. Operation Dragoon was considered a success by the Allies. It enabled them to liberate most of Southern France in a time span of only four weeks, while inflicting heavy casualties on the German forces, although a substantial part of the best German units were able to escape. The captured French ports were put into operation, allowing the Allies to solve their supply problems soon after.\nevents: t0: July 1944, t1: 15August 1944, t2: July, t3: August, t4: 14September, e0: Operation, e1: planned, e2: led to, e3: reconsidered, e4: supply, e5: pushed, e6: approved, e7: increase, e8: opening, e9: landed, e10: followed, e11: opposed, e12: weakened, e13: hindered, e14: uprising, e15: resistance, e16: defeated, e17: withdrew, e18: establish, e19: defense, e20: overtake, e21: block, e22: led to, e23: achieve, e24: complete, e25: withdrawal, e26: retreat, e27: retreating, e28: capture, e29: putting, e30: hold, e31: ordered, e32: withdrawal, e33: retreated, e34: pursued, e35: came to, e36: establish, e37: defense, e38: meeting with, e39: facing, e40: halted, e41: liberate, e42: inflicting, e43: casualties, e44: escape, e45: put, e46: allowing, e47: solve\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation. The conflict began after the Soviets sought to obtain some Finnish territory, demanding among other concessions that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons—primarily the protection of Leningrad, from the Finnish border. Finland refused, so the USSR invaded the country. Many sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland, and use the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols as evidence of this, while other sources argue against the idea of the full Soviet conquest. Finland repelled Soviet attacks for more than two months and inflicted substantial losses on the invaders while temperatures ranged as low as . After the Soviet military reorganised and adopted different tactics, they renewed their offensive in February and overcame Finnish defences. Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Finland ceded 11 percent of its territory representing 30 percent of its economy to the Soviet Union. Soviet losses were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered. Soviet gains exceeded their pre-war demands and the USSR received substantial territory along Lake Ladoga and in northern Finland. Finland retained its sovereignty and enhanced its international reputation. The poor performance of the Red Army encouraged Adolf Hitler to think that an attack on the Soviet Union would be successful and confirmed negative Western opinions of the Soviet military.

The fourth named storm of the 1994–95 Australian region cyclone season, Bobby developed as a tropical low embedded within a monsoon trough situated north of the Northern Territory coastline on 19 February. The storm gradually drifted southwestward and later southward under low wind shear, strengthening enough to be assigned the name "Bobby" by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). The storm rapidly deepened as it approached the coast of Western Australia, and attained its peak intensity of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg) at 0900 UTC on 24 February with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). After making landfall as a somewhat weaker cyclone near Onslow, the remnants of Bobby drifted southeastward, gradually weakening, before dissipating over the southern reaches of Western Australia. Bobby inflicted minor damage throughout Western Australia, dropping copious rainfall and forcing the closure of many facilities and roads. The storm\'s destruction was most severe in Onslow, where 20 residences suffered damage. Elsewhere, Bobby knocked out power and water supplies, unroofed houses, tore off rain gutters, toppled fences, and smashed windows. The flooding of a stretch of the Eyre Highway stranded approximately 1000 vehicles, although the backup was later cleared more than a week later. Flooding disrupted mining and drilling operations throughout southwestern Australia, costing the industry upwards of $50 million (1995 AUD; $38.7 million USD). Numerous Australian Army and State Emergency Service (SES) personnel were involved in cleanup and recovery efforts after the cyclone\'s passage, while power and water service was restored to those cut off during the storm. Overall, the cyclone caused eight deaths and $11 million (1995 AUD; $8.5 million USD) in damage along its course across Western Australia.\nevents: t0: February 1995, t1: 1994–95, t2: 19 February, t3: 24 February, t4: 10-minute, e0: Cyclone, e1: dropping, e2: storm, e3: developed, e4: storm, e5: drifted, e6: strengthening, e7: assigned, e8: storm, e9: deepened, e10: approached, e11: attained, e12: making, e13: drifted, e14: weakening, e15: dissipating, e16: inflicted, e17: damage, e18: dropping, e19: forcing, e20: closure, e21: storm, e22: destruction, e23: damage, e24: knocked out, e25: unroofed, e26: tore, e27: toppled, e28: smashed, e29: flooding, e30: cleared, e31: disrupted, e32: costing, e33: involved, e34: cleanup, e35: recovery, e36: restored, e37: cyclone, e38: caused, e39: deaths, e40: damage\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Part of a series of storms to impact the group of islands early that year, Pat was first identified as a tropical depression on February 6 well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. The storm steadily organized as it moved generally southeast, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 8. Turning to the south, intensification began in earnest and the system acquired hurricane-force winds within 48 hours of being named. The wide system displayed annular characteristics and a wide eye. Pat reached its peak strength early on February 10 as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). Hours later it struck Aitutaki, producing gusts in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) on the island. Hostile wind shear then prompted rapid weakening of the cyclone. The system degraded below gale-intensity on February 11, just 24 hours after it peaked, and was last noted early on February 12. Battering Aitutaki with wind gusts in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78 percent of homes were damaged, with 72 structures destroyed. The electrical grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7 million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government.

See Bushfires in Australia for an explanation of regional seasons. The 2006–07 season included the "Victorian Alpine Fire Complex" which was the longest running collection of bushfires in Victoria\'s history. On 1 December 2006, more than 70 fires were caused by lightning strikes in the Victorian Alps, many of which eventually merged to become the Great Divide Complex, which burned for 69 days across about a million hectares. Despite the length of the season and amount of land burnt, the fires were contained to mostly unoccupied regions such as the Victorian Alps, national parks and remnant bushland. Evacuation plans were implemented in many small towns in these areas, a combination of these factors resulted in only one fatality as a result of the fires.\nevents: t0: 2006–07, t1: 69 days, t2: 2006–07, t3: 1 December 2006, t4: 69 days, e0: bushfire, e1: bushfire, e2: burning, e3: bushfire, e4: fires, e5: burning, e6: Bushfires, e7: Fire, e8: bushfires, e9: fires, e10: caused, e11: merged, e12: become, e13: burned, e14: burnt, e15: fires, e16: contained, e17: implemented, e18: resulted in, e19: fatality, e20: fires\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Although there has been research on the idea of a separate Spanish American ("creole") identity separate from that of Iberia, political independence was not initially the aim of most Spanish Americans, nor was it necessarily inevitable. After the restoration of rule by Ferdinand VII in 1814, and his rejection of the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, the monarchy as well as liberals hardened their stance toward its overseas possessions, and they in turn increasingly sought political independence. The violent conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito in opposing the government of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. In 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas when the Central Junta fell to the French invasion. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to many crown policies, "there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French." While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary, most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the region\'s autonomy from the French. Over the course of the next decade, the political instability in Spain and the absolutist restoration under Ferdinand VII convinced many Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the mother country. These conflicts were fought both as irregular warfare and conventional warfare, and as wars of national liberation and civil wars. The conflicts among the colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina, Chile, and Peru in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish–American War in 1898. The new republics from the beginning abolished the formal system of racial classification and hierarchy, casta system, the Inquisition, and noble titles. Slavery was not abolished immediately but ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century. Criollos (those of Spanish descent born in the New World) and mestizos (those of mixed American Indian and Spanish blood or culture) replaced Spanish-born appointees in most political governments. Criollos remained at the top of a social structure that retained some of its traditional features culturally, if not legally. For almost a century thereafter, conservatives and liberals fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions. The events in Spanish America were related to the wars of independence in the former French colony of St-Domingue, Haiti, and the transition to independence in Brazil. Brazil\'s independence, in particular, shared a common starting point with that of Spanish America, since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleon\'s invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which forced the Portuguese royal family to flee to Brazil in 1807. The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the Age of Enlightenment and that influenced all of the Atlantic Revolutions, including the earlier revolutions in the United States and France. A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the Kingdom of Spain and its monarchy during this era.\nevents: t0: 1807, t1: the early 19th century, t2: 1814, t3: 1812, t4: 1809, t5: 1810, t6: 1807, t7: over the course of the next decade, t8: a quarter century, t9: almost a century thereafter, t10: Europe \'s Napoleonic Wars, t11: the first third of the 19th century, t12: 1898, t13: this era, e0: wars, e1: took place, e2: research, e3: restoration, e4: rejection, e5: hardened, e6: started, e7: established, e8: opposing, e9: appeared, e10: fell, e11: support, e12: formed, e13: believed, e14: supported, e15: convinced, e16: establish, e17: conflicts, e18: fought, e19: warfare, e20: warfare, e21: wars, e22: wars, e23: resulted in, e24: remained, e25: abolished, e26: abolished, e27: ended, e28: replaced, e29: remained, e30: retained, e31: fought, e32: changes, e33: rebellions, e34: wars, e35: conflicts, e36: triggered, e37: took place, e38: emerged, e39: influenced, e40: wars, e41: occurring\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

In the first incident, area residents attributed the killing of a miner to a band of Ho-Chunk warriors, and concluded that more Ho-Chunk planned to join Black Hawk in his war against white settlers. The second incident occurred east of the fort as a Sauk raiding party, estimated by eyewitnesses to be as large as 100 warriors, attacked two militiamen who were investigating noises heard the night before. Two members of the militia stationed at Blue Mounds were killed in the attack, and both their bodies were badly mutilated. The attacks followed an increase in tension after the Hall sisters were released at Fort Blue Mounds on June 1. The sisters had been kidnapped during the Indian Creek massacre in May and were brought to Blue Mounds by a party of Ho-Chunk. Militia leader Henry Dodge became suspicious of the Ho-Chunk and took them prisoner, though they were later released as tension between the Ho-Chunk and white settlers increased. The attacks also lent credence to the belief that more Ho-Chunk were set to join Black Hawk's war against white settlers in Illinois and Michigan Territory.

The second tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed on May 26 from a low-pressure system offshore North Carolina. Initially subtropical, the storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics as it tracked across warmer sea surface temperatures and within an environment of decreasing vertical wind shear. Late on May 27, Beryl transitioned into a tropical cyclone less than from North Florida. Early the following day, the storm moved ashore near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, dropping heavy rainfall while moving slowly across the southeastern United States. A cold front turned Beryl to the northeast, and the storm became extratropical on May 30. The precursor to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000 people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions and put out wildfires along the storm's path. A fallen tree killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. In northeast North Carolina, Beryl spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes near the city of Peletier.

A maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII ("Severe") was assessed for several locations, though less intense shaking was observed at many other locations in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. Some of these intermediate outlying areas reported V ("Moderate") to VII ("Very strong") shaking, but intensities as high as IV ("Light") were reported as far distant as Idaho and Montana. Due to the remote location of the mainshock and a series of strong aftershocks, damage to man made structures was limited to a few cabins close to the areas of the highest intensity. Because the earthquake occurred before seismometers were operating in the region, the magnitude of the shock and its location were never precisely determined, but the intensity reports that are available for the event were studied, and various epicenters for the event were proposed based on these limited data. One study presented an estimated of 6.5–7.0, with a proposed location on the east side of the Cascade Range near Lake Chelan. The results of a separate study indicated that it may have been a larger event, placing the shock in the North Cascades, just south of the Canada–United States border at Ross Lake.\nevents: t0: 1872, e0: earthquake, e1: occurred, e2: assessed, e3: shaking, e4: observed, e5: reported, e6: shaking, e7: reported, e8: mainshock, e9: aftershocks, e10: damage, e11: made, e12: limited, e13: earthquake, e14: occurred, e15: operating, e16: shock, e17: determined, e18: reports, e19: event, e20: studied, e21: event, e22: proposed, e23: study, e24: presented, e25: proposed, e26: study, e27: indicated, e28: event, e29: placing, e30: shock\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The collision occurred at an altitude of (flight level 130). Both aircraft lost their right wings and tails, went out of control and crashed about one or two minutes later near the village of Zolochiv, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union, killing all 94 people on both aircraft. Civil and military air traffic controllers mislocated both aircraft involved, leading to violations of air traffic control rules.

The battle went on for 21 days from August 23 to September 13, 1921, close to the banks of the Sakarya River in the immediate vicinity of Polatlı, which is today a district of the Ankara Province. The battle line stretched over 62 miles (100 km). It is also known as the Officers\' Battle () in Turkey because of the unusually high casualty rate (70–80%) among the officers. Later, it was also called "Melhâme-i Kübrâ" (equivalent to Armageddon) by Atatürk. The Battle of Sakarya is considered as the turning point of the Turkish War of Independence.

Key events occurred on 8 August 1988 and therefore it is known as the 8888 Uprising. The protests began as a student movement and were organised largely by university students at the Rangoon Arts and Sciences University and the Rangoon Institute of Technology (RIT). Since 1962, the Burma Socialist Programme Party had ruled the country as a totalitarian one-party state, headed by General Ne Win. Under the government agenda, called the Burmese Way to Socialism, which involved economic isolation and strengthening the military, Burma became one of the world\'s most impoverished countries. Many firms in the formal sector of the economy were nationalised, and the government combined Soviet-style central planning with Buddhist and traditional beliefs. The 8888 uprising was started by students in Yangon (Rangoon) on 8 August 1988. Student protests spread throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of monks, children, university students, housewives, doctors and common people protested against the government. The uprising ended on 18 September after a bloody military coup by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Thousands of deaths have been attributed to the military during this uprising, while authorities in Myanmar put the figure at around 350 people killed. During the crisis, Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a national icon. When the military junta arranged an election in 1990, her party, the National League for Democracy, won 81% of the seats in the government (392 out of 492). However, the military junta refused to recognise the results and continued ruling the country as the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Aung San Suu Kyi was also put under house arrest. The State Law and Order Restoration Council would be a cosmetic change from the Burma Socialist Programme Party. Suu Kyi\'s house arrest was lifted in 2010, when worldwide attention for her peaked again during the making of the biographical film "The Lady".\nevents: t0: August 1988, t1: 8 August 1988, t2: 1962, t3: 8 August 1988, t4: 18 September, t5: 1990, t6: 2010, t7: 1988, e0: Protests, e1: Uprisings, e2: Uprising, e3: Uprising, e4: unrest, e5: occurred, e6: Uprising, e7: protests, e8: began, e9: organised, e10: ruled, e11: headed, e12: called, e13: strengthening, e14: became, e15: nationalised, e16: combined, e17: uprising, e18: started, e19: protests, e20: spread, e21: uprising, e22: ended, e23: deaths, e24: attributed, e25: uprising, e26: put, e27: killed, e28: crisis, e29: emerged, e30: arranged, e31: election, e32: refused, e33: results, e34: continued, e35: put, e36: arrest, e37: change, e38: arrest, e39: peaked\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Traditionally, the beginning of the war is dated as September 18, 1810. Depending on what terms are used to define its end, it lasted until 1821, when royalist forces were defeated by José de San Martín; or until 1826, when the last Spanish troops surrendered and the Chiloé Archipelago was incorporated to the Chilean republic. A declaration of independence was officially issued by Chile on February 12, 1818 and formally recognized by Spain in 1844, when full diplomatic relations were established. The Chilean War of Independence was part of the more aroused Spanish American wars of independence. Independence did not have unanimous support among Chileans, who were divided between independentists and royalists. What started as a political movement among elites against the colonial power, ended as a full-fledged civil war. Traditionally, the process is divided into three stages: the "Patria Vieja", 1810–1814; the "Reconquista", 1814–1817; and the "Patria Nueva", 1817–1823.\nevents: t0: September 18 , 1810, t1: 1821, t2: 1826, t3: February 12 , 1818, t4: 1844, t5: 1810–1814, t6: 1817–1823, t7: 1814–1817, e0: War, e1: war, e2: supporting, e3: beginning, e4: war, e5: used, e6: end, e7: defeated, e8: surrendered, e9: incorporated, e10: declaration, e11: recognized, e12: established, e13: War, e14: wars, e15: support, e16: started, e17: ended, e18: war\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

An investigation under the PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, the day after the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders. The week after the fire, city officials announced a compensation plan for victims of the fire and their families.

The explosions occurred around midday at Shepherd\'s Bush, Warren Street and Oval stations on the London Underground, and on London Buses route 26 in Bethnal Green on Hackney Road. A fifth bomber dumped his device without attempting to set it off. Connecting lines and stations were closed and evacuated. Metropolitan Police later said the intention was to cause large-scale loss of life, but only the detonators of the bombs exploded, probably causing the popping sounds reported by witnesses, and only one minor injury was reported. The suspects fled the scenes after their bombs failed to explode. On Friday 22 July, CCTV images of four suspects wanted in connection with the bombings were released. Two of the men shown in these images were identified by police on Monday 25 July as Muktar Said Ibrahim and Yasin Hassan Omar. The resultant manhunt was described by the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair as "the greatest operational challenge ever faced" by the Met. During the manhunt, police misidentified Jean Charles de Menezes as one of the suspected bombers and shot and killed him. By 29 July, police had arrested all four of the main bombing suspects from 21 July attempted bombings. Yasin Hassan Omar was arrested by police on 27 July, in Birmingham. On 29 July, two more suspects were arrested in London. A fourth suspect, Osman Hussein, was arrested in Rome, Italy, and later extradited to the UK. Police also arrested numerous other people in the course of their investigations.

They occurred at the Markale (marketplace) located in the historic core of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first occurred on 5 February 1994; 68 people were killed and 144 more were wounded by a mortar. The second occurred on 28 August 1995 when five mortar shells killed 43 people and wounded 75 others. The latter attack was the alleged reason for NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces that would eventually lead to the Dayton Peace Accords and the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The responsibility of the Army of the Republika Srpska for the first shelling is contested. since investigations to establish the location from where the shells had been fired led to ambiguous results. It was claimed that the Bosnian army had actually shelled its own people in order to provoke intervention of Western countries on their side. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its appeal judgement of Stanislav Galić in 2006 summarized the evidence and ruled that the conclusion that the shells had been fired from a location occupied by Serbian forces was a reasonable one; nevertheless, Radovan Karadžić during his trial before ICTY tried to use this claim to his defense, but was found guilty.\nevents: t0: 5 February 1994, t1: 28 August 1995, t2: 2006, e0: shelling, e1: carried out, e2: targeting, e3: occurred, e4: occurred, e5: killed, e6: wounded, e7: occurred, e8: killed, e9: wounded, e10: attack, e11: lead to, e12: end, e13: shelling, e14: establish, e15: led to, e16: claimed, e17: shelled, e18: summarized, e19: ruled, e20: fired, e21: found\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The storm tracked generally westward, reaching peak winds of before passing through the Bahamas. After weakening somewhat, the storm later passed across southern Florida with winds of . The hurricane then emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm, but regained hurricane intensity and made another landfall along the Florida Panhandle. Turning northeast, it crossed Georgia and South Carolina, and entered the Atlantic Ocean on October 8. In advance of the storm, preparations were extensive; residents boarded up homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas. In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of Nassau was struck particularly hard. In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns. In the Everglades region, a storm surge flooded local streets. As the storm progressed northward, the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted US$675,000 ($ 2011 USD) in damage.

On August 12, 1985, a Boeing 747SR operating this route suffered a sudden decompression twelve minutes into the flight and crashed in the area of Mount Takamagahara, Ueno, Gunma Prefecture, from Tokyo thirty-two minutes later. The crash site was on Osutaka Ridge, near Mount Osutaka. Japan's Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission officially concluded that the rapid decompression was caused by a faulty repair by Boeing technicians after a tailstrike incident during a landing at Osaka Airport seven years earlier in 1978. A doubler plate on the rear bulkhead of the plane had been improperly repaired, compromising the plane's airworthiness. Cabin pressurization continued to expand and contract the improperly repaired bulkhead until the day of the accident, when the faulty repair finally failed, causing the rapid decompression that ripped off a large portion of the tail and caused the loss of hydraulic controls to the entire plane. The aircraft, configured with increased economy class seating, was carrying 524 people. Casualties of the crash included all 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers. Some passengers survived the initial crash but subsequently died of their injuries hours later, mostly due to the Japan Self-Defense Forces' decision to wait until the next day to go to the crash site, after declining an offer from a nearby United States Air Force base to start an immediate rescue operation.

After the capture of Pärnu, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, commander of the Lithuanian army, moved towards Riga, which was occupied by the Swedes under the command of Joachim Frederick von Mansfeld. Along the way, Chodkiewicz saw a chance to destroy the Swedish squadron based in the Salis port which blocked Riga. The dominant presence of the Swedes in the Baltic region gave the Lithuanian army the upper hand, as von Mansfeld and the Swedish army did not expect the possibility of an attack in such a heavily Swedish-occupied region. Chodkiewicz's army consisted of two ships obtained in Pärnu, filled with Samogitians infantry and armed with cannons brought in from Pärnu castle. The squadron was additionally reinforced by a few hastily armed merchant ships (probably five) purchased from the English and Dutch , and a couple of boats and bateaux. To assist in managing vessel traffic, Chodkiewicz hired a few sailors, mainly Livonian. On the night of March 23, Chodkiewicz's army (consisting of Samogitians, Livonians, and probably some bribed members of the Swedish infantry) surprise-attacked the Swedish fleet. Using the favourable winds blowing inland, Chodkiewicz sent several (probably four) fire ships (their first use in the Baltic in modern times) into the port, setting several ships on fire and pushing them in the direction of the Swedish warships anchored in formation. Unprepared for the attack, the Swedish attempted to save their ships by cutting their anchor ropes and to flee. Despite this, two Swedish ships were burned and soon sank. Retreating from the port, the Swedish unit came under fire by Samogitians ships waiting at the roadstead. Chodkiewicz's Swedish squadron did not attempt to engage in an artillery fight and immediately escaped to the waters of the Gulf of Riga. Samogitians units, slower than the Swedish ships, did not attempt to pursue them. The entire Port of Salis, together with stocks of weapons, ammunition and food, fell into the hands of the Samogitians.

Within twelve hours, more than 180 fires fanned by winds of up to 110 km/h (68 mph) caused widespread destruction across the states of Victoria and South Australia. Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia's worst fire days in a century. The fires became the deadliest bushfire in Australian history until the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009. In Victoria 47 people died. There were 28 deaths in South Australia. This included 14 CFA and 3 CFS volunteer fire-fighters who died across both states that day. Many fatalities were as a result of firestorm conditions caused by a sudden and violent wind change in the evening which rapidly changed the direction and size of the fire front. The speed and ferocity of the flames, aided by abundant fuels and a landscape immersed in smoke, made fire suppression and containment impossible. In many cases, residents fended for themselves as fires broke communications, cut off escape routes and severed electricity and water supplies. Up to 8,000 people were evacuated in Victoria at the height of the crisis and a state of disaster was declared for the first time in South Australia's history. More than 35 townhouses were burned in a small town in Victoria. Ash Wednesday was one of Australia's costliest natural disasters. More than 3,700 buildings were destroyed or damaged and 2,545 individuals and families lost their homes. Livestock losses were very high, with more than 340,000 sheep, 18,000 cattle and numerous native animals either dead or later destroyed. A total of 4,540 insurance claims were paid totalling A$176 million with a total estimated cost of well over $400 million (1983 values) for both states or $1.3 billion in adjusted terms (2007). The emergency saw the largest number of volunteers called to duty from across Australia at the same time—an estimated 130,000 firefighters, defence force personnel, relief workers and support crews.\nevents: t0: 16 February 1983, t1: 2009, t2: that day, t3: 2007, t4: a century, t5: twelve hours, e0: bushfires, e1: known, e2: bushfires, e3: occurred, e4: fires, e5: fanned, e6: caused, e7: destruction, e8: drought, e9: combined, e10: create, e11: fire, e12: fires, e13: became, e14: bushfire, e15: bushfires, e16: died, e17: deaths, e18: died, e19: fatalities, e20: caused, e21: change, e22: changed, e23: fire, e24: aided, e25: immersed, e26: made, e27: suppression, e28: fended, e29: fires, e30: communications, e31: cut off, e32: escape, e33: severed, e34: evacuated, e35: declared, e36: burned, e37: disasters, e38: destroyed, e39: damaged, e40: lost, e41: losses, e42: dead, e43: destroyed, e44: claims, e45: paid, e46: cost, e47: adjusted, e48: called, e49: relief, e50: support\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The disaster was the most severe nuclear accident since the 26 April 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the only other disaster to be given the Level 7 event classification of the International Nuclear Event Scale. The accident was started by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. On detecting the earthquake, the active reactors automatically shut down their fission reactions. Because of the reactor trips and other grid problems, the electricity supply failed, and the reactors\' emergency diesel generators automatically started. Critically, they were powering the pumps that circulated coolant through the reactors\' cores to remove decay heat, which continues after fission has ceased. The earthquake generated a 14-meter-high tsunami that arrived 46 minutes later, sweeping over the plant\'s seawall and flooding the plant\'s lower grounds around the Units 1-4 reactor buildings with sea water, which filled the basements and knocked out the emergency generators. The resultant loss-of-coolant accidents led to three nuclear meltdowns, three hydrogen explosions, and the release of radioactive contamination in Units 1, 2 and 3 between 12 and 15 March. The spent fuel pool of previously shutdown Reactor 4 increased in temperature on 15 March due to decay heat from newly-added spent fuel rods; but did not boil down sufficiently to expose the fuel. In the days after the accident, radiation released to the atmosphere forced the government to declare an ever larger evacuation zone around the plant, culminating in an evacuation zone with a 20-kilometer radius. All told, some 154,000 residents evacuated from the communities surrounding the plant due to the rising off-site levels of ambient ionizing radiation caused by airborne radioactive contamination from the damaged reactors. Large amounts of water contaminated with radioactive isotopes were released into the Pacific Ocean during and after the disaster. Michio Aoyama, a professor of radioisotope geoscience at the Institute of Environmental Radioactivity, has estimated that 18,000 terabecquerel (TBq) of radioactive caesium 137 were released into the Pacific during the accident, and in 2013, 30 gigabecquerel (GBq) of caesium 137 were still flowing into the ocean every day. The plant\'s operator has since built new walls along the coast and also created a 1.5-kilometer-long "ice wall" of frozen earth to stop the flow of contaminated water. While there has been ongoing controversy over the health effects of the disaster, a 2014 report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and World Health Organization projected no increase in miscarriages, stillbirths or physical and mental disorders in babies born after the accident. An ongoing intensive cleanup program to both decontaminate affected areas and decommission the plant will take 30 to 40 years, plant management estimate. On 5 July 2012, the National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) found that the causes of the accident had been foreseeable, and that the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), had failed to meet basic safety requirements such as risk assessment, preparing for containing collateral damage, and developing evacuation plans. At a meeting in Vienna three months after the disaster, the International Atomic Energy Agency faulted lax oversight by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, saying the ministry faced an inherent conflict of interest as the government agency in charge of both regulating and promoting the nuclear power industry. On 12 October 2012, TEPCO admitted for the first time that it had failed to take necessary measures for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.\nevents: t0: 11 March 2011, t1: 46 minutes later, t2: 12, t3: 15 March, t4: 15 March, t5: 2013, t6: 2014, t7: 5 july 2012, t8: 12 October 2012, t9: 26 April 1986, e0: accident, e1: disaster, e2: disaster, e3: given, e4: started, e5: detecting, e6: shut down, e7: started, e8: powering, e9: remove, e10: ceased, e11: generated, e12: arrived, e13: sweeping, e14: flooding, e15: filled, e16: led to, e17: increased, e18: boil down, e19: expose, e20: forced, e21: declare, e22: culminating, e23: evacuated, e24: caused, e25: estimated, e26: flowing, e27: built, e28: created, e29: effects, e30: disaster, e31: report, e32: projected, e33: increase, e34: found, e35: preparing, e36: developing, e37: meeting, e38: oversight, e39: saying, e40: faced, e41: regulating, e42: promoting, e43: lawsuits\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the bomb before detonation and cleared most of the spectators out of the park. Rudolph, a carpenter and handyman, had detonated three pipe bombs inside a U.S. military ALICE Pack. After the bombings, Jewell was temporarily investigated as a suspect by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the news media falsely focused on him aggressively as the presumed culprit. However, in October 1996, Jewell was exonerated when the FBI declared that he was no longer a person of interest. Following three more bombings in 1997, Rudolph was identified by the FBI as the suspect. In 2003, Rudolph was arrested and tried before being convicted two years later.

By winning for a third successive time Tom Morris, Jr. gained permanent possession of the Challenge Belt. The contest took place the day after the autumn meeting of the club. A published notice for the benefit of prospective entrants to the tournament read, "On Thurs the 15th Sept. the CHAMPION BELT, given by the Prestwick Golf Club, and open to all Members of Established Golf Clubs and Professionals, will be competed for". Tommy Morris\'s first round of 47 (3-5-3-5-6-3-3-3-4-3-4-5) was two shots better than his previous record round in 1868. This gave him a five shot lead over Bob Kirk. After a second round 51 he held a five shot lead over Davie Strath. A final 51 extended his lead to 12 shots. His final score of 149 was 5 shots better than the previous record set in 1868. There were 20 starters but only 17 returned scores. Morris returned to St Andrews by train, late on Saturday evening.

The matches were played in Uganda, a decision which Tanzania protested, but to no avail. Tanzania were also banned from international football by FIFA, the world football governing body. The matches were played from 18 November to 2 December 2000. Prior to the tournament, Djibouti withdrew due to monetary difficulties, but re-entered. Sudan and Zanzibar also withdrew, but stayed out. The reasoning behind their withdrawal was unknown. Nine teams entered the tournament, as opposed to the twelve teams competing at the previous tournament in 1999. However, there were only eight different nations competing in the tournament as Uganda entered two teams: Uganda (A) and Uganda (B). Uganda (A) was in Group A, and Uganda (B) was in Group B, enabling the two the correct set-up to be able to meet each other in the final, as occurred here. Both Ugandas topped their respective groups, and progressed to the knockout stages along with Ethiopia and Rwanda. Uganda (A) beat Rwanda, and Uganda (B) beat Ethiopia to mean that "the Cranes" (Uganda [A]) and "the Lions" (Uganda (B)) would meet in the final. In the final, Uganda (A) captained by George Ssimwogerere of Express, won 2–0.

The war was part of a long-running dispute between Argentina and Brazil for influence over Uruguay and Paraguay, and hegemony over the Platine region (areas bordering the Río de la Plata). The conflict took place in Uruguay and northeastern Argentina, and on the Río de la Plata. Uruguay\'s internal troubles, including the long-running Uruguayan Civil War ("La Guerra Grande" – "The Great War"), were heavily influential factors leading to the Platine War. In 1850, the Platine region was politically unstable. Although the Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, had gained dictatorial control over other Argentine provinces, his rule was plagued by a series of regional rebellions. Meanwhile, Uruguay struggled with its own civil war, which started after gaining independence from the Brazilian Empire in 1828 in the Cisplatine War. Rosas backed the Uruguayan Blanco party in this conflict, and further desired to extend Argentine borders to areas formerly occupied by the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This meant asserting control over Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia. This threatened Brazilian interests and sovereignty since the old Spanish Viceroyalty had also included territories which had long been incorporated into the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Brazil actively pursued ways to eliminate the threat from Rosas. In 1851, it allied with the Argentine breakaway provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios (led by Justo José de Urquiza), and the anti-Rosas Colorado party in Uruguay. Brazil next secured the south-western flank by signing defensive alliances with Paraguay and Bolivia. Faced with an offensive alliance against his regime, Rosas declared war on Brazil. Allied forces first advanced into Uruguayan territory, defeating Rosas\' Blanco party supporters led by Manuel Oribe. Afterwards, the Allied army was divided, with the main arm advancing by land to engage Rosas\' main defenses and the other launching a seaborne assault directed at Buenos Aires. The Platine War ended in 1852 with the Allied victory at the Battle of Caseros, for some time establishing Brazilian hegemony over much of South America. The war ushered in a period of economic and political stability in the Empire of Brazil. With Rosas gone, Argentina began a political process which would result in a more unified state. However, the end of the Platine war did not completely resolve issues within the Platine region. Turmoil continued in subsequent years, with internal disputes among political factions in Uruguay, a long civil war in Argentina, and an emergent Paraguay asserting its claims. Two more major international wars (see:Paraguayan War) followed during the next two decades, sparked by territorial ambitions and conflicts over influence.\nevents: t0: 18 August 1851 – 3 February 1852, t1: 1850, t2: 1828, t3: 1851, t4: 1852, t5: years, e0: fought, e1: war, e2: dispute, e3: influence, e4: took place, e5: leading to, e6: gained, e7: plagued, e8: struggled, e9: war, e10: started, e11: gaining, e12: extend, e13: occupied, e14: asserting, e15: threatened, e16: incorporated, e17: pursued, e18: eliminate, e19: allied, e20: signing, e21: declared, e22: advanced, e23: defeating, e24: advancing, e25: engage, e26: launching, e27: ended, e28: establishing, e29: war, e30: began, e31: war, e32: resolve, e33: continued, e34: war, e35: asserting, e36: wars, e37: sparked\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It was the first storm on record to affect all of those areas. It originated from a tropical wave over Africa, and became a tropical depression by September 21. It moved slowly westward, initially failing to intensify much; it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Inez on September 24. The storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the French overseas region of Guadeloupe on September 27. Inez severely damaged the island's banana and sugar crops, and thousands of homes were damaged, leaving 10,000 people homeless. Damage on Guadeloupe was estimated at $50 million, and there were 40 deaths. After entering the Caribbean, Inez briefly weakened before restrengthening, attaining peak sustained winds of on September 28. That day a hurricane hunters flight reported a gust of , which was the highest recorded at the time. Continuing westward, Inez made landfall as a small hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800 houses. Nationwide, there were about 100 deaths and $12 million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000 people were killed, and 60,000 people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35 million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September 30. In the country, 125,000 people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20 million in damage. The hurricane moved slowly over Cuba for two days before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5 million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160 homes and 190 trailers were damaged. Salt spray damaged crops in the region, and there was $5 million in damage and four deaths. In the Straits of Florida, Inez capsized a boat of Cuban refugees, killing 45 people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11 people. The hurricane threatened the northern Yucatán Peninsula, and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of Tamaulipas and cut off roads to Tampico. About 84,000 people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500 houses. Damage was estimated at $104 million, and there were 74 deaths in Mexico.\nevents: t0: 1966, t1: September 21, t2: september 24, t3: September 27, t4: September 28, t5: nearly ten years, t6: September 30, t7: two days, t8: 1920s, e0: hurricane, e1: affected, e2: affect, e3: originated, e4: became, e5: moved, e6: intensify, e7: upgraded, e8: strengthened, e9: hurricane, e10: intensifying, e11: struck, e12: damaged, e13: damaged, e14: leaving, e15: entering, e16: weakened, e17: attaining, e18: hurricane, e19: reported, e20: landfall, e21: hurricane, e22: flooded, e23: destroyed, e24: affecting, e25: struck, e26: hurricane, e27: killed, e28: left, e29: prompting, e30: send, e31: weakened, e32: hurricane, e33: striking, e34: evacuate, e35: hurricane, e36: moved, e37: emerging, e38: stalled, e39: caused, e40: killed, e41: left, e42: occurred, e43: damaged, e44: damaged, e45: killing, e46: crashed, e47: carrying, e48: killing, e49: hurricane, e50: threatened, e51: caused, e52: landfall, e53: flooded, e54: cut, e55: left, e56: hurricane, e57: destroyed\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The residents of Stavyshche rebelled against Polish rule, and as a result, the town was destroyed in January 1665. In mid-1664, Polish forces under Czarniecki raided Right-bank Ukraine. At the same time, the town of Stavyshche/Stawiszcze, located near Kiev rebelled against Polish rule (see Treaty of Andrusovo). Its siege began on July 7, and lasted four months, after which the defenders surrendered, due to hunger and lack of ammunition. Leaders of the rebellion were caught and killed, and the town had to pay a large fine to Polish troops. Soon afterwards, another rebellion began at Stavyshche.

On the first day, Saint-Priest's Russians and General Friedrich Wilhelm von Jagow's Prussians easily captured Reims from its French National Guard garrison, capturing or killing more than half of its defenders. On the second day, an overconfident Saint-Priest carelessly deployed his forces west of the city, not grasping that Napoleon was approaching with 20,000 troops.

It saw vast areas of Buchan in northeast Scotland, then ruled by Clan Comyn, burned to the ground by Robert the Bruce and his brother Edward, immediately following their May 1308 success at the Battle of Barra. After his defeat at Barra, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan fled to England. Bruce's men chased him as far as Turriff, a distance of sixteen miles (25 km). Before heading south to lay siege to Aberdeen Castle, the Bruces laid waste the Earldom of Buchan, including all the castles and strongholds, principally Rattray Castle and Dundarg Castle. Bruce's men proceeded to kill those loyal to the Comyns, destroying their homes, farms, crops and slaughtering their cattle. This was a ruthless exercise by fire and sword which even in an age of violence was regarded as unprecedentedly savage. Terrorising the locals, Bruce prevented any possible chance of future violent hostility towards him and his men. The Comyns had ruled Buchan for nearly a century, from 1214, when William Comyn inherited the title from his wife. Such was the destruction however, that the people of Buchan lost all loyalties to the Comyns and never again rose against Bruce's supporters. It took thirty years before John Comyn's successor to the Earldom, Henry Beaumont, made an appearance in the area. Between 1333–34, he repaired Dundarg Castle which Bruce had destroyed during the harrying, only for it to be laid siege to and destroyed by Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell in December 1336. Finding little support, he left after the siege to England where he died in 1340. His son John refused the Earldom, ending the Comyn lineage and the first creation, Mormaers of Buchan.\nevents: t0: May 1308, t1: 1214, t2: 1333–34, t3: December 1336, t4: 1340, t5: 1308, t6: the Wars of Scottish Independence, t7: thirty years, e0: took place, e1: ruled, e2: burned, e3: defeat, e4: fled, e5: chased, e6: heading, e7: siege, e8: proceeded, e9: kill, e10: destroying, e11: slaughtering, e12: regarded, e13: Terrorising, e14: prevented, e15: ruled, e16: inherited, e17: lost, e18: rose, e19: took, e20: repaired, e21: destroyed, e22: siege, e23: destroyed, e24: Finding, e25: left, e26: died, e27: refused, e28: ending\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

The system was first noted as a shallow depression within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the west of Wallis Island. Over the next three days the system moved towards the west-northwest, before it was named Sina during November 24, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Over the next couple of days the system intensified further and developed an eye feature as it erratically moved towards Fiji. Sina subsequently peaked in intensity during November 26, before the system passed through the Fijian Islands over the next two days as it started to gradually weaken. Sina subsequently passed just to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga during November 29, before it passed about 160 km (100 mi) to the south of Niue and near the Southern Cook Islands during the next day. The system subsequently rapidly weakened and became an extratropical cyclone during December 1, before they were absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50°S on December 4. The cyclone caused no deaths and over in damages, as it affected Fiji, Tonga, Niue and the Southern Cook Islands. Ahead of the system affecting Fiji, hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. High winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the main Nadi International Airport. As Sina moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also washed away a railway bridge on Vanua Levu that was used to take sugar cane to Labasa's mills, leaving growers no choice but to go through the village of Korowiri. However, the workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through the village, after Methodists from the local church attacked a group of growers for working on Sundays in defiance of Fiji's Sunday Observance Decree. Within Tonga only minor damage to weak structures, trees, banana plantations, electric and telephone lines was recorded.

A British squadron had been blockading the French island of Isle de France (now Mauritius) since early in the year, and early on 5 May discovered two ships approaching their position. As the strange vessels came closer, they were recognised as the French frigate "Duguay Trouin", which had been captured from the East India Company the year before, and a small brig. Making use of a favourable wind, the British squadron gave chase to the new arrivals, which fled. The chase was short, as "Duguay Trouin" was a poor sailor with many of the crew sick and unable to report for duty. The British frigate HMS "Orpheus" was the first to arrive, and soon completely disabled the French frigate, successfully raking the wallowing ship. After an hour and twenty minutes the French captain surrendered, Captain Henry Newcome of "Orpheus" taking over the captured ship and bringing his prize back to port in India.\nevents: t0: 5 May 1794, t1: 5 May, e0: engagement, e1: fought, e2: Wars, e3: blockading, e4: discovered, e5: approaching, e6: came, e7: recognised, e8: captured, e9: gave, e10: chase, e11: fled, e12: chase, e13: arrive, e14: disabled, e15: raking, e16: surrendered, e17: taking over, e18: bringing\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The eleventh named storm, seventh hurricane, and third major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Kate originated from the interaction of an upper-level trough and tropical wave northeast of Puerto Rico on November 15. Though the system tracked erratically during the first hours of its existence, the intensification of a region of high pressure to the cyclone's north caused Kate to turn westward. A favorable atmospheric pattern allowed the newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on November 16, and further to Category 2 intensity three days later. Kate made its first landfall on the northern coast of Cuba at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November 19. Once clear of land, it began to strengthen quickly, becoming a Category 3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) the following day. On November 21, a cold front moving across the Mississippi Valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone, and on November 22, Kate came ashore near Mexico Beach, Florida, as a minimal Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) . Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the Southeast United States coastline, and Kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November 23, a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina. The threat of Hurricane Kate in Cuba prompted the evacuation of 360,000 people. Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding, killing 10 people and leading to severe agriculture damage. Wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages, significant building damage, and major crop damage. Damage totaled roughly $400 million, making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades. In preparation for the system's arrival, many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect. Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated, and Florida governor Bob Graham declared a state of emergency for six counties; this was later cancelled following the relatively minor impacts of Kate. In addition, many shelters were opened. When Kate struck the Florida Panhandle, it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100 mph (160 km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15 fatalities and $700 million in damage.\nevents: t0: 1985, t1: November 15, t2: November 16, t3: November 21, t4: November 22, t5: November 23, t6: 1975, t7: three days later, t8: the following day, e0: impact, e1: strike, e2: storm, e3: hurricane, e4: hurricane, e5: originated, e6: tracked, e7: caused, e8: allowed, e9: intensify, e10: landfall, e11: emerging, e12: began, e13: strengthen, e14: becoming, e15: reaching, e16: resulted in, e17: came, e18: hurricane, e19: weakening, e20: ensued, e21: moved, e22: transitioned, e23: exiting, e24: prompted, e25: caused, e26: killing, e27: leading to, e28: resulted in, e29: Damage, e30: making it, e31: hurricane, e32: strike, e33: arrival, e34: warnings, e35: put, e36: evacuated, e37: declared, e38: cancelled, e39: impacts, e40: opened, e41: struck, e42: became, e43: hurricane, e44: make, e45: destroyed, e46: causing, e47: contributed, e48: led to, e49: resulted in\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III. The Dutch believed they had found a more reliable client in his uncle Pangeran Puger. Tensions increased when Amangkurat was accused of giving refuge to the rebel Surapati. Pangeran Puger accused Amangkurat before the Dutch of planning an uprising in East Java. Unlike Pangeran Puger, Amangkurat III inherited blood connection with Surabayan ruler, Jangrana II, from Amangkurat II and this lent credibility to the allegation that he cooperated with the now powerful Untung Surapati in Pasuruan. Panembahan Cakraningrat II of Madura, VOC’s most trusted ally, persuaded the Dutch to support Pangeran Puger. Pangeran Puger took the title of Pakubuwana I upon his accession in June 1704. Together with the Dutch, Pakubuwono defeated Amangkurat who fled east and received refuge from Surapati who had set up his own kingdom. The war dragged on for five years before the Dutch managed to install Pakubuwana. In August 1705, Pakubuwono I’s retainers and VOC forces captured Kartasura without resistance from Amangkurat III, whose forces cowardly turned back when the enemy reached Ungaran. Surapati’s forces in Bangil, near Pasuruan, was crushed by the alliance of VOC, Kartasura and Madura in 1706. Jangrana II, who tended to side with Amangkurat III and did not venture any assistance to the capture of Bangil, was called to present himself before Pakubuwana I and murdered there by VOC’s request in the same year. Amangkurat III ran away to Malang with Surapati’s descendants and his remnant forces but Malang was then a no-man’s-land who offered no glory fit for a king. Therefore, though allied operations to the eastern interior of Java in 1706–08 did not gain much success in military terms, the fallen king surrendered in 1708 after being lured with the promises of household (lungguh) and land, but he was banished to Ceylon along with his wives and children.\nevents: t0: 1703, t1: June 1704, t2: August 1705, t3: 1706, t4: 1708, t5: 1706–08, t6: five years, e0: War, e1: struggle, e2: supported, e3: claim, e4: died, e5: succeeded, e6: believed, e7: found, e8: increased, e9: accused, e10: giving, e11: accused, e12: planning, e13: uprising, e14: cooperated, e15: persuaded, e16: support, e17: defeated, e18: fled, e19: received, e20: refuge, e21: set up, e22: dragged on, e23: captured, e24: resistance, e25: turned, e26: reached, e27: crushed, e28: venture, e29: assistance, e30: capture, e31: called, e32: murdered, e33: request, e34: ran away, e35: offered, e36: gain, e37: surrendered, e38: lured, e39: banished\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

It was held between 21 July and 20 August in Ottawa. The conference saw the group admit the failure of the gold standard and abandon attempts to return to it. The meeting also worked to establish a zone of limited tariffs within the British Empire, but with high tariffs with the rest of the world. This was called "Imperial preference" or "Empire Free-Trade" on the principle of "home producers first, empire producers second, and foreign producers last". The result of the conference was a series of bilateral agreements that would last for at least 5 years. This abandonment of open free trade led to a split in the British National Government coalition: the Official Liberals under Herbert Samuel left the Government, but the National Liberals under Sir John Simon remained. The conference was especially notable for its adoption of Keynesian ideas such as lowering interest rates, increasing the money supply, and expanding government spending. The United States were annoyed by the implementation of Imperial Preference as it affected them economically. It was the last Imperial Conference that any Irish government participated in, and also the last that Newfoundland attended as an independent Dominion.

It was the first event in the Elimination Chamber chronology. Six matches were aired on the broadcast and one dark match occurred prior to the live broadcast. The concept of the event was that the two main event matches, one each for the World Heavyweight Championship and the WWE Championship, would occur in an Elimination Chamber. Each match featured six competitors: the defending champion and five challengers. Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Triple H, Ted DiBiase, Randy Orton, John Cena, and Kofi Kingston in the Raw Elimination Chamber. In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho, John Morrison, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk, and R-Truth. On the undercard, Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kane, The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against Montel Vontavious Porter, and Maryse and Gail Kim competed against LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in an interbrand Divas tag team match. The event received 285,000 pay-per-view buys, an increase on the figure earned by the 2009 No Way Out pay-per-view. Despite the increased number of buys, the event received generally negative reviews, with reviewers criticising the undercard of the show as being "weak" and consisting of "filler" material.\nevents: t0: 2010, t1: 2010, t2: February 21 , 2010, t3: 2009, e0: wrestling, e1: event, e2: produced, e3: took place, e4: event, e5: matches, e6: aired, e7: match, e8: occurred, e9: matches, e10: occur, e11: match, e12: defending, e13: defended, e14: match, e15: defended, e16: defended, e17: defended, e18: competed, e19: match, e20: event, e21: received, e22: increase, e23: earned, e24: increased, e25: event, e26: received, e27: criticising\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

It resulted in the fall of the Sikh Empire, and the annexation of the Punjab and what subsequently became the North-West Frontier Province, by the East India Company. On 19 April 1848 Patrick Vans Agnew of the civil service and Lieutenant William Anderson of the Bombay European regiment, having been sent to take charge of Multan from Diwan Mulraj, were murdered there, and within a short time the Sikh troops joined in open rebellion. Governor-General of India Lord Dalhousie agreed with Sir Hugh Gough, the commander-in-chief, that the British East India Company's military forces were neither adequately equipped with transport and supplies, nor otherwise prepared to take the field immediately. He also foresaw the spread of the rebellion, and the necessity that must arise, not merely for the capture of Multan, but also for the entire subjugation of the Punjab. He therefore resolutely delayed to strike, organized a strong army for operations in November, and himself proceeded to the Punjab. Despite the brilliant successes gained by Herbert Edwardes in the Second Anglo-Sikh War with Mulraj, and Gough's indecisive victories at Ramnagar in November, at Sadulapur in December, and at the Battle of Chillianwala on 13 January 1849, the stubborn resistance at Multan showed that the task required the utmost resources of the government. At length, on 22 January, the Multan fortress was taken by General Whish, who was thus set at liberty to join Gough at Gujarat. Here a complete victory was won on 21 February at the Battle of Gujrat, the Sikh army reveller stop fighting at Rawalpindi, and their Afghan allies were chased out of India. After the victory at Gujarat, Lord Dalhousie annexed the Punjab for the East India Company in 1849.

Eight days into the Iran–Iraq War, Operation Scorch Sword commenced. At dawn on 30 September 1980, four Iranian F-4E Phantom jets refueled mid-air near the Iran-Iraq border. After crossing into Iraq, the fighters climbed to a higher altitude to be undetectable by Iraqi radar. Moments later, two of the Phantoms peeled off, and dropped to a lower altitude again to avoid radar detection. They flew stealthily to Tuwaitha, a city ten miles (17.58 km) southeast of Baghdad, home to the "Osirak" nuclear reactor. This was the first attack on a nuclear reactor and only the third on a nuclear facility in history. It was also the first instance of a preventive attack on a nuclear reactor, the intent of which was to forestall the development of a nuclear weapon.

The Australian edition of the tournament featured three teams played across three matches at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on July 18, 21 and 24. Real Madrid were the first club to announce their involvement. Manchester City and Roma were later confirmed to take part in the Australian tournament. The Chinese edition of the tournament featured Real Madrid, Milan and Inter Milan playing a total of three matches in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai. Real Madrid won both the Australian and the Chinese competitions. The North American edition of the tournament featured 10 teams but some games were played in Mexico, Canada, Italy and England. Each team involved in the US edition played four games, except the three United States-based teams that only played two games. Select Major League Soccer (MLS) matches between the ICC competing teams counted towards the point total to allow MLS teams to have four games count on the table. 2014 International Champions Cup winners Manchester United were the first team to confirm their involvement in the US edition.\nevents: t0: 2015, t1: 24, t2: 2014, t3: July 18, t4: 21, e0: tournaments, e1: tournament, e2: played, e3: tournament, e4: played, e5: matches, e6: announce, e7: involvement, e8: confirmed, e9: tournament, e10: tournament, e11: playing, e12: matches, e13: competitions, e14: tournament, e15: games, e16: played, e17: played, e18: games, e19: played, e20: games, e21: Select, e22: matches, e23: allow, e24: games, e25: confirm, e26: involvement\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.

Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia; Iskra formed the northern part of the wider Soviet 1942–1943 winter counter-offensive. The operation was conducted by the Red Army\'s Leningrad Front, Volkhov Front, and the Baltic Fleet from 12 to 30 January 1943 with the aim of creating a land connection to Leningrad. Soviet forces linked up on 18 January, and by 22 January the front line had stabilised. The operation successfully opened a land corridor wide to the city. A railroad was swiftly built through the corridor which allowed more supplies to reach the city than the Road of Life across the frozen surface of Lake Ladoga, significantly reducing the possibility of the capture of the city and any German–Finnish linkup. The success led to Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda less than two weeks later, which aimed to decisively defeat Army Group North, lifting the siege altogether. Polyarnaya Zvezda failed, achieving only minimal progress. Soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 to renew their offensive and to lift the siege completely, but made only modest gains in each one. The corridor remained within range of German artillery, and the Red Army did not finally lift the siege until a year later, on 27 January 1944.\nevents: t0: January 1943, t1: World War II, t2: late 1942, t3: January 1943, t4: 12, t5: 30 January 1943, t6: 18 January, t7: 22 January, t8: 1943, t9: a year later, t10: 27 January 1944, t11: 1942–1943, e0: aimed, e1: began, e2: weakened, e3: planning, e4: formed, e5: conducted, e6: creating, e7: linked, e8: opened, e9: built, e10: allowed, e11: reducing, e12: led to, e13: aimed, e14: achieving, e15: made, e16: renew, e17: remained\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

This was the second major military standoff between India and Pakistan following the successful detonation of nuclear devices by both countries in 1998, with the first being the Kargil War of 1999. The military buildup was initiated by India responding to a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament on 13 December 2001 (during which twelve people, including the five terrorists who attacked the building, were killed) and the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly on 1 October 2001. India claimed that the attacks were carried out by two Pakistan-based terror groups fighting Indian administered Kashmir, the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, both of whom India has said are backed by Pakistan\'s ISI–a charge that Pakistan denied. In Western media, coverage of the standoff focused on the possibility of a nuclear war between the two countries and the implications of the potential conflict on the American-led "Global War on Terrorism" in nearby Afghanistan. Tensions de-escalated following international diplomatic mediation which resulted in the October 2002 withdrawal of Indian and Pakistani troops from the international border.\nevents: t0: 1998, t1: 1999, t2: 13 december 2001, t3: 1 october 2001, t4: October 2002, e0: standoff, e1: resulted in, e2: buildup, e3: initiated, e4: responding, e5: attack, e6: killed, e7: claimed, e8: attacks, e9: carried out, e10: fighting, e11: said, e12: charge, e13: denied, e14: standoff, e15: focused, e16: mediation, e17: resulted in, e18: withdrawal\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous \'t\' refers to the time point.

The operation was carried out by an ad hoc airborne formation called the 1st Airborne Task Force. Operation Rugby was itself part of the Operation Dragoon invasion of Southern France by the American 7th Army. The airborne task force landed in the River Argens valley with the objective of preventing German reinforcements from reaching the landing beaches. The landings were mainly an American operation and the brigade was the only British Army formation involved. The brigade's pathfinders landed accurately and set up their homing beacons, but the main body of the brigade landed over a large area, some away. The following glider force also had problems; weather conditions forced the brigade's anti-tank unit to turn back for Italy and return with the second wave later that day. Eventually the brigade captured their primary objectives, but the lack of manpower meant that their secondary objective of Le Muy was given to the American airborne forces. The seaborne and airborne landings linked up within two days, and the brigade became the reserve formation for the operation. As a British withdrawal from France at the earliest opportunity had been the original intent, the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing. The operation had cost the brigade 362 casualties, but this did not hinder their next mission in Greece two months later. Only 126 replacements were required to bring the brigade back up to full strength.\nevents: t0: two days, t1: eleven days, t2: August 1944, t3: two months later, e0: landings, e1: operation, e2: carried out, e3: Operation, e4: invasion, e5: landed, e6: preventing, e7: reaching, e8: landings, e9: landed, e10: set up, e11: landed, e12: forced, e13: turn, e14: return, e15: captured, e16: given, e17: landings, e18: linked, e19: became, e20: operation, e21: withdrawal, e22: boarded, e23: landing, e24: operation, e25: cost, e26: casualties, e27: hinder, e28: mission, e29: required, e30: bring\n\nThe events sorted by the order of appearance in the text and the previous 't' refers to the time point.
