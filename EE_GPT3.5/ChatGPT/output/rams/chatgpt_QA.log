Throughout the period of the Cuban revolution , 1959 to the present , Latin America has witnessed a terrible parade of human rights violations – systematic , routine torture ; legions of “ disappeared ” people ; government - supported death squads picking off selected individuals ; massacres en masse of peasants , students and other groups . The worst perpetrators of these acts during this period have been the military and associated paramilitary squads of El Salvador , Guatemala , Brazil , Argentina , Chile , Colombia , Peru , Mexico , Uruguay , Haiti and Honduras . However , not even Cuba ’s worst enemies have made serious charges against the Havana government for any of such violations ; and if one further considers education and health care , “ both of which,”\x9d said President Bill Clinton , “ work better [ in Cuba ] than most other countries ” , and both of which are guaranteed by the United Nations “ Universal Declaration of Human Rights ” and the “ European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ” , then it would appear that during the more - than - half century of its revolution , Cuba has enjoyed one of the very best human - rights records in all of Latin America .\nevent: massacres\nevent type: conflict.attack.selfdirectedbattle\nPlease identify the attacker, target, place for this event', 'A': 'I am sorry, but the given event type, conflict.attack.selfdirectedbattle, does not match the given event, massacres, as massacres do not fit the criteria for a self-directed battle.
